# Compass — `scripts/`

Reference utility scripts and templates that complement Compass workflows. Each entry is single-file. Adopt as-is or fork for team-specific needs.

**Owner convention:** scripts in this directory are operated by the **Project Manager** role (matching the existing `/status` + `/plan` ownership of "make work visible" jobs). The `agent-handoff.yml` template is consumed by Engineer / Reviewer roles through CI rather than invoked by PM directly — it lives here because it ships with Compass as a reference, alongside `token-usage.py`.

## `token-usage.py` — per-role token rollup

Parses a Claude Code session log and a Compass workflow markdown file; attributes tokens to roles using the workflow's `COMPASS_ROLE_BOUNDARY` markers as anchors (per the `[role-boundary]` Compass-original pattern in `compass/framework/canon.md`); produces a markdown report.

### What it produces

- **Per-workflow cost** — total input + output tokens, $ estimate at current Anthropic Sonnet 4.x pricing
- **Per-role rollup** — table of input/output/total/$ by role, sorted by total descending
- **Per-step breakdown** — table mapping each workflow step to its attributed tokens with cumulative %
- **Confidence footer** — names the heuristics used so readers know the accuracy bounds

### Usage

```bash
# Stdout
python compass/scripts/token-usage.py ~/.config/claude-code/sessions/<session>.jsonl

# Write to file (PM archive)
python compass/scripts/token-usage.py <session-log> --out docs/usage/build-2026-05-27.md

# Force a specific workflow file (otherwise auto-detected from the first slash-command in the session)
python compass/scripts/token-usage.py <session-log> --workflow compass/workflows/build.md

# Custom pricing (defaults: $3/M input, $15/M output — adjust to your model)
python compass/scripts/token-usage.py <session-log> --price-in 3.0 --price-out 15.0
```

### Finding Claude Code session logs

The exact path depends on your Claude Code version + OS. Common locations:

- **macOS:** `~/.config/claude-code/sessions/` or `~/Library/Application Support/claude-code/sessions/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/claude-code/sessions/`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\claude-code\sessions\`

If you can't find them, check Claude Code settings or run `claude-code --help` for the current session-log path. The script accepts either JSON or JSONL format; Claude Code typically writes JSONL.

### Accuracy honesty

This is a **rough estimator**, not exact attribution. Heuristics used:

- **Linear step assumption** — messages mapped to workflow steps by ordinal position. Out-of-order execution = off attribution.
- **Multi-message-per-step approximation** — divides total messages evenly across steps. Heavy steps are under-counted; light steps are over-counted.
- **User-interrupt sensitivity** — user messages mid-session shift the mapping.
- **Tool-call attribution** — per step, not per tool call within a step.
- **Pricing assumption** — Anthropic Sonnet 4.x current rates (configurable).

The report's Confidence footer names all of these explicitly so consumers know the bounds.

**For exact attribution, AI-tool integration is required** (Claude Code feature request territory). This script is the reference round-1 implementation per the `[role-boundary]` pattern — round 2+ accuracy lands when richer AI-tool instrumentation matures.

### How the markers work

Compass workflows in v0.3.4+ include HTML-comment markers at role load/transition points:

```markdown
### 3. Engineer implements

<!-- COMPASS_ROLE_BOUNDARY: enter | role=engineer | workflow=build | step=3 -->

**Work (Claude):** Engineer implements the story...

<!-- COMPASS_ROLE_BOUNDARY: exit | role=engineer | workflow=build | step=7 -->
```

The script reads these markers from the workflow file referenced by the session's initial slash-command. If a workflow has no markers (most v0.2.x and pre-v0.3.4 workflows), the script falls back to attributing everything to `(unattributed)`. Add markers to a workflow when you want per-role visibility for it.

### When to use this

- **Cost transparency** — periodic check of what Compass costs in your project
- **Role optimization** — identify role docs that consume disproportionate tokens (candidates for tightening)
- **Debugging / explainability** — when a workflow run feels expensive, see where the tokens went
- **Team reporting** — aggregate across many sessions (current script handles one at a time; team-wide rollup is v0.3.x+ territory)

PM-owned by convention — see `compass/roles/project-manager.md` for token-usage rollup as a PM responsibility.

## `agent-handoff.yml` — GitHub Actions reviewer template

> Last verified against vendor CLIs: **2026-06-01**. Freshness window: **30 days**.
> External sources tracked: `https://github.com/openai/codex` · `https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code` · `https://github.com/google/gemini-cli`.
> Re-verify install commands + invocation flags before the window expires; bump `last_verified` after confirmation. Per `[freshness-check]` (canon.md).

Automates the Engineer → Reviewer handoff for `/build`. When CI passes on a PR, the workflow runs the reviewer agent against the diff and posts findings as a PR comment. The sending agent (Claude) reads the comment back via GitHub MCP the next session — no terminal switch, no manual prompt paste.

Per the `[agent-handoff]` Compass-original pattern in `compass/framework/canon.md` (v0.3.5).

### Setup in your consuming repo

1. **Copy the template** to your repo: `cp compass/scripts/agent-handoff.yml .github/workflows/ai-review.yml` (in the consuming repo, not the Compass repo).
2. **Set the CI workflow name** in the `workflows:` line near the top of the file to match YOUR CI workflow's `name:` value (the human-readable name, not the YAML file name).
3. **Add the API-key secret** matching the reviewer block you enable, in your repo's GitHub Settings → Secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (Option A — Codex)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Option B — Claude headless)
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Option C — Gemini)
   - Your provider's key (Option D — generic)
4. **Pick ONE reviewer block** in the YAML; leave the others commented out.
5. **Verify the install command + CLI flags** for your chosen reviewer against current vendor docs. The values shipped are best-effort references; CLI surfaces drift.

After the first PR opens, the action runs on CI completion; findings post as a PR comment. Claude (next session) reads them via GitHub MCP and addresses BLOCKERs / ISSUEs.

### Handoff shape (per [agent-handoff])

| Piece | Value |
|---|---|
| **Trigger artifact** | The PR (opened or synchronized) |
| **Trigger event** | `workflow_run` on CI completion |
| **Context window** | `pr.diff` + your reviewer prompt file |
| **Output medium** | PR comment (posted via `gh pr comment`) |
| **Loop signal** | Claude reads PR comments via GitHub MCP next session |

### Agent-agnostic by design

The template ships with four reviewer blocks (Codex / Claude headless / Gemini / generic CLI). Each block: install CLI · invoke with prompt + diff · capture findings to `review.md`. The default-enabled block is Codex (matching the canonical Compass tool division: Claude implements, Codex reviews); the alternatives match alternate setups.

### Accuracy honesty + caveats

- **Vendor CLI drift is real.** The `npm install` packages and CLI flags shown are placeholder references. Verify against current vendor docs before adoption; the freshness markers above name the window.
- **No replay protection.** If CI re-runs, the workflow re-runs and posts another review comment. Acceptable for most teams; if noisy, add a `concurrency:` group or check for existing review comments before posting.
- **Cost.** Every PR (and every `git push` while CI re-runs) triggers a reviewer invocation. Budget accordingly — for high-PR-volume repos, consider gating on a label (`needs-review`) instead of every CI-green.
- **Auth model.** GitHub Actions writes the review comment using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. The reviewer agent uses YOUR API key (one of the secrets above). Both must be set.

### Manual fallback always supported

If the template isn't installed, the Engineer → Reviewer handoff stays manual exactly as it was pre-v0.3.5: terminal → `codex` → reviewer prompt → PR. Both paths terminate at the same place (findings as PR comment); automation removes the tool-switch only. See `compass/roles/reviewer.md` → "How you're invoked."

## Future scripts + templates

Reference implementations may join this directory as Compass evolves. Candidates:

- **Freshness detector** (v0.3.6+) — CI script that watches external-tool sources (Codex changelog, MCP schemas, library release notes, Vercel deploys, AND the CLIs referenced by `agent-handoff.yml`) and auto-bumps `last_verified` markers on Compass docs. Slipped from v0.3.4 → v0.3.5+ → v0.3.6+ as token tracking and handoff automation took priority.
- **Multi-session aggregator** — wraps `token-usage.py` across many session logs for team-level reporting
- **Marker linter** — validates `COMPASS_ROLE_BOUNDARY` markers in workflows are well-formed (enter/exit balance, valid role names, no orphans)
- **Handoff replay** — for repos with high PR volume, gates `agent-handoff.yml` invocation on labels or checks existing comments to avoid duplicate reviews
- **Cross-agent codex parser** — `token-usage-codex.py` for attributing Codex CLI session tokens (parallel to `token-usage.py` for Claude Code; same protocol, different log format)

Add scripts here when problems are structurally hard to solve with markdown docs alone. **Keep them single-file and minimal-dependency** — same discipline as `token-usage.py` (stdlib-only Python) and `agent-handoff.yml` (vanilla GitHub Actions).
