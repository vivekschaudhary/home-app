# <Title>

## Problem

<One paragraph. The user pain. Avoid jumping to a solution.>

## User

<Specific role / segment / job-to-be-done.>

## Why this matters

<Strategic context. Why is this on the roadmap and not something else?>

## Hypothesis (the bet)

<If we ship <X>, then <user> will <outcome>, measured by <metric> reaching <target> within <window>.>

## Defensibility (optional for feature bets)

If this feature ships and works, does it strengthen any moat? Examples:
- Increases switching costs by adding workflow embedding
- Generates proprietary usage data
- Strengthens brand in a specific user segment

If no — that's fine, not every feature contributes to defensibility. But name it explicitly rather than skip.

**Moat impact (one line):**

## Scope

### In scope
-

### Out of scope

## Open questions for Researcher

## Research findings

_To be filled by Researcher (or in a separate `research.md`)._

## User pain input (from Support)

_To be filled by Support._

## Stories

_Decomposed one at a time via `/create-story`. Each lives under `stories/<story-id>/`._

## Check-in log

_Populated automatically by `/measure` cron._
