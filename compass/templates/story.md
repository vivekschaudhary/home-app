# <Story Title>

## Description

<One paragraph: what this story delivers, from the user's perspective.>

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC 1: <specific, testable>
- [ ] AC 2:
- [ ] AC 3:

## Standard Experience Checklist

PM fills this when writing the story. Each category is either covered by **≥1 AC item above** OR explicitly marked **`n/a — <reason>`**. Empty cells (no AC reference AND no `n/a`) fail the `/create-story` gate. This is the bridge between Designer's "every state per screen" completeness and the Engineer's implementation contract — what the Designer drew but the AC doesn't say will ship missing.

- [ ] **Navigation** — back / exit / cancel / dismiss path defined for every navigable surface: `<covered by AC-N | n/a — reason>`
- [ ] **States** — loading / empty / error / success / disabled each has an AC line: `<list AC numbers | n/a — reason>`
- [ ] **Feedback** — error messages discriminate type (network / validation / server / permissions / unknown); success acknowledgments where action is taken; destructive actions confirm before executing: `<covered by AC-N | n/a — reason>`
- [ ] **Accessibility** — focus management on mount + state change; keyboard navigation (tab order, Enter/Esc); screen reader labels for non-text controls: `<covered by AC-N | n/a — reason>`
- [ ] **Edge cases** — offline behavior, slow network (skeleton vs spinner threshold), permissions-denied, missing-data: `<covered by AC-N | n/a — reason>`
- [ ] **Cross-surface consistency** (if multi-target stack: web + mobile + native) — behavior matches across surfaces or divergence explicitly justified: `<covered by AC-N | n/a — reason>`

## PRs

_Auto-populated as PRs open. A story may have multiple PRs (implementation, tests, defect fixes)._

- PR #N — <description> — status

## Tests

_Engineer writes unit/API/component tests co-located with code._
