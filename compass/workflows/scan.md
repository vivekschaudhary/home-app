# Workflow: /scan

Continuous quality scanner for the product lifecycle. Modeled on Snyk / Semgrep / GitHub Advanced Security — produces **findings, not failures**. Severity + confidence + location + reason + fix per finding. Owners decide; the scanner informs.

## Trigger

- `/scan <bet-id>` — scan one bet
- `/scan --all` — aggregate posture across all active bets (one report per bet + aggregate roll-up in chat)
- `/scan --phase <name>` — single-phase scan across all bets (e.g., `/scan --phase production-ready`)
- **Auto-invoked** by `/build` at phase boundaries (Build → Production Ready, → GTM, → Operate)
- **Cron-invoked** per `compass/config.yaml` `scanner.cron`

## State detection

| State                                          | Action                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bet ID not provided AND no `--all` / `--phase` | **Refuse.** Tell user to specify a bet or use `--all`.                    |
| Bet doesn't exist at `docs/bets/<bet-id>/`     | **Refuse.** Pointer to `/create-brief` or `/create-bet-portfolio`.        |
| Previous scan report exists                    | Preserve existing suppressions; re-render report; bump version.           |
| No previous scan report                        | First scan — seed report with full check sweep.                           |

## Process

1. Verify bet exists (or `--all` mode).
2. **Load Scanner role context** (`compass/roles/scanner.md`).
3. **Determine current phase** from bet frontmatter + artifact statuses:
   - Brief exists, status `proposed` → **Product** (in review)
   - Brief `approved`, no architecture → **Architecture** (or Build if arch declined)
   - Architecture `approved`, stories not all shipped → **Build**
   - Stories shipped, runbook/SLO missing → **Production Ready**
   - Production Ready complete, no GTM artifacts → **GTM**
   - GTM complete OR bet `shipped`/`measuring` → **Operate**
4. **Read artifacts + MCP data** per the catalog below.
5. **Run checks for current phase + all prior phases** (later phases not yet entered are reported as "phase not yet active").
6. **Preserve suppressions** from previous report. Flag stale ones (rationale > 90 days old OR underlying check changed).
7. **Compute confidence** per finding using the three signals (content depth, source freshness, cross-artifact corroboration) — state the reasoning briefly in the Reason field.
8. **Write `docs/bets/<bet-id>/scan-report.md`** from `compass/templates/scan-report.md`. Update frontmatter (`scanned_at`, `current_phase`, `open_findings` counts, `suppressed_findings`, `blocking_advance`).
9. **Append a Scan history row** in the report.
10. **Output summary in chat** — open-findings counts by severity, blocking status, link to full report.
11. **Log DRI Issues** on the bet for any Critical / High findings (severity-matched).
12. **Auto-run `/dashboard`** to refresh `docs/dashboard.html` so the latest findings are visible in the browser view. Skip only if `docs/foundation/product.md` is missing (dashboard would refuse anyway).
13. **No HITL gate on the scan itself.** HITL only applies to suppressions of Critical findings.

## Verification (mandatory)

- [ ] Scan report exists at `docs/bets/<bet-id>/scan-report.md` with frontmatter populated
- [ ] Every finding has severity + confidence + location + reason + fix (no blank fields)
- [ ] Reason field states the confidence-derivation reasoning briefly
- [ ] Suppressed findings preserved from previous report (with original metadata + suppressor + rationale)
- [ ] `blocking_advance: true` iff any unresolved Critical exists per `compass/config.yaml` `scanner.per_phase` mode
- [ ] DRI Issues logged on the bet for Critical / High findings
- [ ] Status: `living`
- [ ] Scan history row appended

| OP-02 | SLO breach (production observability MCP shows SLO violation in window) | Critical | No | all production-bound bets |
| OP-03 | Elevated incident rate (Sentry MCP shows incident rate > threshold) | High | Yes (HITL, with rationale) | all production-bound bets |
| OP-04 | Adoption below target (analytics MCP shows adoption < hypothesis target) | Medium | N/A — informational; feeds outcome decision | feature, okr |
| OP-05 | Cost overrun (cost actuals exceed forecast > 20%) | High | Yes (DRI) | all production-bound bets |

## Confidence derivation (canonical)

For every check, derive confidence as one of High / Medium / Low using these signals:

1. **Content depth** — file existence vs. file with substance. Compare against the template's required sections. `TODO`, `TBD`, `<placeholder>` strings → reduce confidence one level.
2. **Source freshness** — last update timestamp on the artifact relative to bet's activity. Stale artifacts (last touched > 30 days while bet is active) → reduce confidence one level.
3. **Cross-artifact corroboration** — claims in artifact A verified against MCP or artifact B. Contradiction → finding raised at Low confidence (one source is wrong; flag both).

State the reasoning briefly in the finding's Reason field. Example: *"Runbook exists but only 12 lines; missing diagnostic steps section per template. → Medium confidence (file exists but minimal)."*

## Suppression policy (canonical)

Per `compass/config.yaml` `scanner.suppression_policy`:

| Severity | Policy |
|---|---|
| Critical | HITL approval + DRI risk-acceptance entry. Some Critical findings are **non-suppressible** (see check catalog above — typically PII / regulated data / breaking changes). |
| High | DRI justification required (auto-logged on suppression). |
| Medium | Owner accepts; auto-logged in DRI. |
| Low | Silent dismissal; still logged in DRI for audit. |

Suppressions appear in the **Suppressed findings** section of the scan report with: original finding · suppressor name · date · rationale · DRI link.

## Aggregate roll-up (`--all` mode)

When `/scan --all` runs, in addition to per-bet reports, the chat output includes:

```
🧭 Compass — Open Findings
Total: N across M active bets
• Critical: X · High: Y · Medium: Z · Low: W
Most common findings:
  • <Title> (N bets)
Suppressed (accepted risk): N
Time-to-remediate (median): D days
Trend: critical findings <↑|↓>X% over N sprints
```

(`/metrics` consumes this same roll-up by reading all `docs/bets/*/scan-report.md` files.)

## Auto-trigger contract

- **`/build`** runs `/scan` at phase boundaries (Build → Production Ready, → GTM, → Operate). In `strict` mode (per `compass/config.yaml` `scanner.per_phase`), any open Critical finding blocks the phase transition; in `advisory` mode, Critical findings warn loudly and auto-log as DRI Risks.
- The `blocking_advance` field on scan reports remains for informational purposes (e.g., consumed by `/dashboard` to surface phase-readiness state). No workflow currently *consumes* `blocking_advance` to block on it — phase transitions happen via direct status-field flips by the user, who reads the scan report to decide.
- **Cron** runs `/scan --all` per `scanner.cron`. Posts roll-up to status channel (per config).

## Refusal cases

- No bet ID provided AND no `--all` / `--phase` flag
- Bet doesn't exist
- `compass/config.yaml` missing `scanner:` section

## Notes

- **Derived, not authored.** Scan report is to per-bet artifacts what `/plan` is to phase outputs — a roll-up view. Hand-editing `scan-report.md` is anti-pattern; the next `/scan` run overwrites (except suppressions, which are preserved by ID).
- **No new framework to learn.** Severity + confidence + suppression are the same shapes engineers use in security tooling. That's the point.
- **Check catalog evolves here.** New checks added to this file (with the bet-type filter), not improvised in the role doc or template.
