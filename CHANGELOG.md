# Changelog

All notable changes to Compass itself (the framework, not project artifacts).

Project work-shipping changelog lives at `docs/changelog.md` — that's for user-visible product changes. This file tracks framework evolution.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

### Added

-

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-22

Initial release. 72 files. 12 roles, 13 workflows, 10 templates, 3 cross-cutting principles.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- Documentation in SETUP.md and README.md explaining how AI tool memory persists across folder deletion at the same path, with cleanup instructions per tool.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- Researcher role gained 6-category source guide (user pain, competitive, technical, quantitative, trends, moat).
- Moat / defensibility analysis added as mandatory step for foundational product bets — all 9 classic moat types must be evaluated (network effects, switching costs, data, scale, brand, regulatory, distribution, talent, speed).
- `docs/foundation/product.md` template includes a Defensibility / Moat section.
- Brief template includes optional Defensibility section for feature bets.
- AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Codex with browser) acknowledged as first-class research tools across all categories.

### Changed
- Researcher role's "Where to research" section completely rewritten with current (2025-2026) sources, replacing generic guidance.

### Fixed
- Source quality hierarchy now explicit; AI summaries placed below primary sources to discourage AI-only research.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-24

### Changed
- `/setup-product` step 3 now explicitly bans "log-and-walk-away" — Researcher must produce evidence in at least User pain, Competitive, and Moat categories. Filing missing research as open DRI Issues is no longer a valid substitute for doing the research.
- `/setup-product` verification checklist tightened: empty moat rows fail; Researcher DRI must include ≥1 Decision AND ≥1 Risk (Issues-only no longer satisfies); findings must cite evidence, not point at TBDs.
- HITL approval gate cannot pass while any verification item is unchecked — made explicit.

### Added
- Researcher role gained "When the source is vision-only" subsection: vision-only sources are the normal starting state for foundational bets, not a reason to defer research.

### Fixed
- Closed an enforcement gap surfaced by a real `/setup-product` run where vision-only source material allowed the Researcher to ship Issues-as-deliverable rather than evidence-as-deliverable.

## [0.1.10] — 2026-05-24

### Changed
- Completed the architecture rename: `compass/workflows/setup-architecture.md` → `setup-foundation-architecture.md` (file + skill directory). The earlier rename had updated docs and the create-architecture half but left this half on the old name.
- All command references standardized on hyphen-slug form (`/setup-product`, `/setup-foundation-architecture`, `/create-bet-architecture`) across README, AGENTS, CLAUDE, PROJECT, SETUP, docs/status, and every role + workflow file. Space-form (`/setup product`, `/setup architecture`) eliminated.

### Fixed
- `.claude/skills/setup-foundation-architecture/SKILL.md` had `name: setup-architecture` while pointing at a workflow path that didn't exist — would have failed silently on first invocation. Skill name now matches its directory and the workflow file it executes.
- Removed duplicate `compass/improvements.md`; merged its contents into the canonical `compass/workflows/improvements.md`.

## [0.1.11] — 2026-05-24

### Changed
- `/setup-foundation-architecture` split into two explicit phases separated by a HITL approval gate. Phase A decides and documents the architecture; Phase B scaffolds the repo. **Scaffolding now waits on explicit human approval of the architecture document — previously it ran before HITL.**
- Enterprise/Solution Architect role now owns a canonical 6-category architecture-research framework (prior art / benchmarks / vendor health / failure modes / pillar fit / reversibility honesty), mirroring the Researcher's 6-category guide.
- Every stack choice in the foundational architecture template must be scored on all 6 AWS Well-Architected pillars (reliability, security, performance efficiency, cost optimization, operational excellence, sustainability) with per-row rationale + cited research. "Smart default" / "team preference" no longer satisfies.
- Alternatives table in the architecture template evaluated against declared fitness functions and pillar tradeoffs — generic Pros / Cons columns dropped; strawmen explicitly disallowed.

### Added
- **Fitness Functions** section in the foundational architecture template — ≥1 measurable target per Well-Architected pillar (6 minimum). These are the architecture bet's falsification criteria.
- **Per-row pillar evaluation + research citations** subsection per stack choice in the template.
- **Architecture Research** section in the template (or pointer to standalone `docs/foundation/architecture-research.md`).
- **"When the product bet is vision-only on workloads"** subsection in the Enterprise/Solution Architect role — workload-shape derivation is the architect's job, not a reason to ask the user or punt.
- Phase A Verification gate (mirrors `/setup-product`'s pattern): empty pillar cells fail; every choice cites research; alternatives tied to fitness functions; EA DRI has Decision + Risk breadth; HITL cannot pass with any unchecked item.
- Phase B Verification gate: scaffold plan listed before write; user confirms; written-files summary produced.
- State-detection table at the top of the workflow routes between Phase A, refusal (proposed-pending-approval), and Phase B based on artifact status.

### Fixed
- Closed the parallel anti-pattern to the Researcher fix: Architect could pick stack choices from "smart defaults" without deriving them from product constraints. The workflow now requires fitness-function derivation, pillar scoring, and cited research before any stack row is accepted.
- Closed the scaffolding-before-approval bug: the prior workflow's HITL gate was the last step, running after the repo had already been scaffolded — backwards.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Foundational Data Model** section in the architecture template and a matching Phase A workflow step (#7). Covers core entities (traced to product bet — no inventions), identity strategy, tenancy model, audit / event-sourcing posture, delete posture, PII handling, timestamps convention, migration strategy, and a Mermaid `erDiagram`. Decided **before** the DB choice so the stack is informed by data shape, not the reverse.
- "Deriving the foundational data model" subsection in the Enterprise/Solution Architect role — explains how each data-model decision is derived from the product bet (entities from nouns, tenancy from personas + moats, audit from compliance, PII from user segment, migration from Reliability + Ops fitness functions).
- Phase A Verification items: data model section present; every entity traces back to product bet; identity / tenancy / audit / delete / PII / timestamps / migration all decided; Mermaid ERD with cardinality; Database row in Stack cites the data model.

### Changed
- Phase A workflow step ordering: research → **data model** → stack choices (was: research → stack choices). Database row in the Stack table now must cite the foundational data model — DB choice that ignores entity shape, tenancy, or audit posture fails verification.
- Phase B step numbers shifted (13–16) to accommodate the new Phase A step. Enterprise Architect role's process list renumbered to match.

### Fixed
- Closed the same decide-before-derive anti-pattern at the data-modeling layer: DB choice was being made as a stack preference rather than derived from the data shape it has to hold. Same pattern as fitness-functions-before-stack and HITL-before-scaffold, now applied at one finer grain.

## [0.1.13] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **`/create-bet-portfolio` workflow** (bootstrap-only). Runs once per project after foundation product + architecture are approved. PM + Researcher draft the MVP wedge as 3-6 stub briefs with a Mermaid dependency graph and parallel-build candidates. After portfolio HITL approval, individual stubs are promoted to full briefs via `/create-brief <bet-id>`.
- **MVP forcing question** in the new workflow: "What does this product need to do for one real user to complete the core value loop once?" Verbatim user answer becomes the load-bearing scope statement.
- **"Deliberately out of MVP" section** in the portfolio doc — captured one-liners for post-MVP items so they aren't lost, but no stub briefs created. Empty section logs a DRI Risk (MVP scope probably padded).
- New template `compass/templates/portfolio.md`.
- New skill `.claude/skills/create-bet-portfolio/SKILL.md`.
- New brief frontmatter fields: `portfolio_stub` (boolean), `depends_on` (list of bet IDs), `parallel_with` (list of bet IDs).

### Changed
- `/create-brief` gained a **promote-stub mode**: when invoked with a bet ID that has a `portfolio_stub: true` brief, it fills in the full content and clears the flag (rather than refusing or creating fresh). Original "create fresh from source" mode is unchanged.
- `/setup-foundation-architecture` final note now points at `/create-bet-portfolio` as the next step for new projects (with `/create-brief` as the path for non-bootstrap single-bet additions).
- AGENTS.md workflow count: 13 → 14. New workflow inserted in the table between `/setup-foundation-architecture` and `/create-brief`.
- SETUP.md "First run" section renumbered (new step 3 = portfolio; old step 3 = step 4; etc.) to slot the bootstrap portfolio between foundation arch and bet-level work.

### Fixed
- Closed the serialization gap during project bootstrap: PM was previously forced to decompose bets one-at-a-time, which meant foundational architecture had to decide knowing only bet 1's needs, teams sat idle waiting for the previous bet to clear, and cross-bet dependencies stayed invisible. The MVP portfolio surfaces the wedge upfront with a dependency graph so parallel build streams can start as soon as portfolio HITL passes.

## [0.1.14] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **`/plan` workflow** + **living `docs/foundation/plan.md`** artifact. Derived from per-bet artifacts (portfolio, briefs, architectures, stories, build state). Refreshed on every `/advance`. Sections: Currently in flight / Next up / Blocked / Done / Full schedule / Calendar view / Refinement log. Status is `living` — never `proposed` or `approved`.
- **Estimate model** that sharpens as phases complete: stub → brief approval (scope) → architecture approval (effort) → stories (count) → build PRs (actuals). Each refinement writes a new `estimate` block to the bet's `brief.md` frontmatter (`duration_weeks`, `confidence`, `refined_by`, `refined_at`).
- **Refinement log** in `plan.md` — every date that moves writes a row naming the triggering artifact. This is the audit trail for "output → input" causality.
- New template `compass/templates/plan.md`.
- New skill `.claude/skills/plan/SKILL.md`.
- `estimate` block added to `compass/templates/brief.md` frontmatter.
- Project Manager role gained `/plan` ownership (alongside `/status` and sprint comms).

### Changed
- `/advance` now auto-runs `/plan` as its final step. This is the load-bearing mechanic that makes "each phase's output is an input to the next phase's plan" real instead of aspirational — users don't have to remember to refresh the plan.
- `/status` now reads `docs/foundation/plan.md` for ETAs / in-flight / next-up rather than recomputing schedule data. Adds a plan-freshness signal (`last_refreshed` age) to the health metrics.
- `/create-bet-portfolio` Output section now points at `/plan` as the next step after portfolio HITL approval (seeds the initial schedule).
- AGENTS.md workflow count: 14 → 15.

### Fixed
- Closed the time-planning gap: the portfolio had a *logical* plan (dependency graph) but no *temporal* plan (dates, calendar, parallel streams visible on a timeline). "When can we ship the MVP?" was unanswerable in concrete dates; parallel-build candidates sat unused; estimates never tightened; slip detection was reactive. `/plan` makes the schedule first-class and refines it as each phase's output lands.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-24

> Major: continuous quality scanner for the product lifecycle. Modeled on Snyk / Semgrep / GitHub Advanced Security.

### Added
- **New `/scan` workflow** + **Scanner role** + **`scan-report.md` template**. Snyk-style continuous quality scanner across six SDLC phases (Product, Architecture, Build, **Production Ready** (new), GTM, Operate). Findings, not failures. Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low) + confidence (High / Medium / Low) + location + reason + fix per finding. Read-only role — owners decide; the scanner informs.
- **Production Ready phase formally introduced** — previously silent in Compass. Eight checks covering runbook, SLO, monitoring, rollback, on-call, backup, cost, compliance.
- **Cross-cutting principle #13** in AGENTS.md: continuous quality scanning with confidence levels. Names the six phases, the finding shape, and the "measurement is automatic — no manual self-assessment" rule.
- **Check catalog** (44 checks across six phases) lives in `compass/workflows/scan.md` as the single source of truth. New checks added there, not improvised by the role.
- **Confidence derivation** is canonical: content depth + source freshness + cross-artifact corroboration. Each finding's Reason field states the reasoning briefly.
- **Suppression policy** in `compass/config.yaml`: HITL-approval-required for Critical (with non-suppressible carve-outs for PII / legal); DRI-justification for High; owner-acceptance-logged for Medium; silent-dismissal-logged for Low.
- **Open Findings section** in `/metrics` output — total by severity, top patterns, suppressions, time-to-remediate, trends.
- **Scan summary section** in brief template — points at the latest `scan-report.md`, shows current open-findings count.
- New skill `.claude/skills/scan/SKILL.md`.
- Role count: 12 → **13** (Scanner). Workflow count: 15 → **16**.

### Changed
- **`/advance` now runs `/scan` before any phase transition.** In `strict` mode (default for Product / Architecture / Build / Production Ready), open Critical findings block advancement. In `advisory` mode (default for GTM / Operate), Critical findings warn loudly and auto-log as DRI Risks. Non-suppressible Critical findings always block.
- **`/build` invokes `/scan` at phase boundaries** — Build → Production Ready, Production Ready → GTM, GTM → Operate. Catches missing production-readiness work *before* the bet is treated as shipped.
- **`/metrics` reads all `docs/bets/*/scan-report.md`** for the new Open Findings posture roll-up.
- **`compass/config.yaml`** gained a `scanner:` section: mode (strict/advisory), per-phase overrides, suppression policy, cron schedule.
- **AGENTS.md** workflow count 15 → 16; role count 12 → 13; principle count 12 → 13.
- **README.md** principles updated with the scanner framing; flow diagram includes `/scan`.

### Fixed
- Closed the "what gates production?" gap. Compass v0.1 had no explicit Production Ready phase — runbook, SLO, monitoring, rollback, backup, on-call, cost, compliance lived as vague intentions across role docs or in nobody's responsibility. v0.2 makes Production Ready a first-class scanned phase with eight checks, several non-suppressible for regulated data.
- Closed the "rubric vs scanner" framing gap. Previous quality-checklist patterns in workflow verification gates were checklists the owner self-applies (boolean: did I do this?). The scanner replaces that for SDLC-wide quality with a Snyk-shaped output engineers already trust — findings with locations, fixes, severity, confidence, suppression with rationale.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **`/dashboard` workflow** + **`docs/dashboard.html`** single-file browser view of all living Compass artifacts (foundation, plan, portfolio, scan reports, metrics, status). One self-contained HTML file. Opens via `file://`. Shareable as an attachment. Six tabs, marked.js + mermaid.js via jsDelivr CDN. CORS-safe — markdown content inlined at generation time, no `fetch()` of local files.
- New template `compass/templates/dashboard.html.template` with `<!-- COMPASS-INSERT:* -->` markers the `/dashboard` workflow fills in.
- New skill `.claude/skills/dashboard/SKILL.md`.
- Project Manager role gained `/dashboard` ownership (fits the rolling-visibility mandate alongside `/status` and `/plan`).

### Changed
- **`/scan`, `/metrics`, `/plan`, `/status` auto-invoke `/dashboard`** as their final step. `/advance` triggers it transitively via its `/plan` step. Browser view never goes stale during normal workflow usage.
- AGENTS.md workflow count: 16 → **17**.
- README.md flow diagram + SETUP.md "Anytime" section mention `/dashboard` for stakeholder sharing.

### Notes
- **Zero-toolchain.** No Node, no Python, no Pandoc, no `node_modules`. AI agent (Claude running `/dashboard`) reads markdown reports and inlines them into the HTML template via the Write tool. Browser renders client-side from CDN-loaded dependencies.
- **Mermaid diagrams** (dependency graphs, ERDs, future Gantt) inside the inlined markdown render as actual diagrams in the dashboard — same Mermaid that GitHub/Confluence render.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-24

### Changed
- **`docs/dashboard.html` now gitignored by convention.** Added to the Compass framework's root `.gitignore` and documented the same recommendation in `SETUP.md` for consuming projects. First real `/dashboard` run produced a ~2500-line HTML file inlining 9 artifacts; every `/scan`, `/plan`, `/metrics`, `/status` rewrites it. Committing produced large, non-meaningful diffs that grow linearly with project size and risked review fatigue masking real template bugs.

### Added
- Explicit rule in the dashboard workflow notes + improvements log: **gitignore only pure views derived from other tracked files with no user-relevant state of their own.** Dashboard fits; other living artifacts (`plan.md` with refinement log, `scan-report.md` with suppressions, dated metrics snapshots, `status.md` history) stay tracked because they carry user state.
- Root `.gitignore` created (didn't exist before).

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-25

### Changed
- **`/dashboard` workflow now forbids silent summarization.** First real `/dashboard` run in a consuming project (aura-app) produced a 42 KB HTML file with 4 of 9 artifacts silently summarized ("executive summaries of the larger sections") to "keep file size manageable." That's a spec violation, not an optimization — summaries make the dashboard a second source of truth that drifts from the underlying markdown. Workflow step 7 now says verbatim is **load-bearing**: do NOT summarize, do NOT truncate, do NOT reword (even for clarity). The only permitted transformation is escaping `</script>` to `<\/script>` inside inlined content.

### Added
- New Verification item in `/dashboard`: every inlined artifact must match source byte-for-byte. Spot-check by `diff`-ing inlined blocks against source `.md` files.
- New anti-pattern in dashboard workflow Notes: "Silent summarization is the failure mode." Names the framing trap ("small file is reviewable") and points at `/dashboard --summary` as a future opt-in if size genuinely becomes a problem.

### Notes
- **No `--summary` flag added yet.** Deferred until real friction emerges at very large project scale (30+ bets, hundreds of artifacts). Don't pre-build escape hatches before the constraint has been tested.
- **No other workflows touched.** `/scan`, `/metrics`, `/plan`, `/status`, `/advance`, `/create-bet-portfolio` are unaffected; the fix is strictly inside `dashboard.md`.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-26

> Two fixes from real-world aura-app friction, both same anti-pattern shape (load-bearing checks that weren't load-bearing in the spec).

### Changed
- **`/build` Phase 2 step 7 + Engineer Definition of Done now require a green production build** (`pnpm build` or framework-equivalent) before opening a PR. Typecheck + unit tests genuinely can't see bundling errors, dead-import elimination, env-var requirements, asset pipeline issues, or monorepo workspace resolution. Real PR from aura-app shipped because these checks weren't required.
- **`/create-bet-architecture` gained a foundational-stack deviation gate** (new step 7). If a bet introduces tools/services/frameworks/data stores/runtimes/dependencies not in `docs/foundation/architecture.md` Stack table, the Architect **must refuse to draft bet architecture** and tell the user to run `/setup-foundation-architecture` in amend mode first. Foundational scope decisions live at foundational level by design; bet architecture is constrained to operate within the foundational stack.
- **`/setup-foundation-architecture` Phase A gained a 4-category signal-consultation step** (production observability / recent PR feedback / prior architectural decisions across bets / bet-architecture deviation pressure). Especially load-bearing for amend flows. Each category produces a citation OR explicit "n/a — <reason>" note. Mirrors Researcher 6-category and Architect 6-pillar enforcement shape.
- **Architect role's Input and Definition of Done** updated to reference the foundational Stack table as canonical and require an explicit "no deviation from foundational stack" assertion (or escalation note).

### Added
- New **`ADR / Amendments` section in `foundation-architecture.md` template** — Architecture Decision Record entries with structured shape (Triggered by / What changed / Why / Reversibility / Cited signal). Required to have ≥1 entry for any foundational version > 1. The foundational arch IS the ADR ledger; no separate ADR file convention.
- Phase A Verification gate items: signal consultation present across all 4 categories; ADR / Amendments entry required when version > 1.

### Fixed
- Closed the "Architect quietly widened the foundational stack inside a bet doc" failure mode. Bets that need new tooling now hit a refuse-and-escalate path that produces a proper foundational ADR — drift becomes structurally impossible without a recorded decision.
- Closed the "Architect made recommendations without consulting available signal" failure mode. Same anti-pattern shape as Researcher v0.1.9 (log-and-walk-away) and dashboard v0.2.3 (silent summarization): soft spec → agent rationalization → fix is making the constraint load-bearing + adding verification + naming the anti-pattern.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-26

> Three fixes from real-world aura-app friction (13 issues triaged → 3 Compass-relevant gaps; the other 10 were app-specific Expo/pnpm/Metro tooling concerns).

### Added
- **`/build` step 7 + Engineer DoD gained a runtime-config audit.** All public-namespace env vars (`*_PUBLIC_*` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` / `VITE_*` / etc.) must have explicit values for the target deploy environment. Dev-only defaults (`localhost`, mock-mode toggles) must **fail loudly at module load** rather than silently fall back. Catches the "default works in dev, app boots into broken state on real device / deployed function" failure mode that prod-build can't see.
- **`/setup-foundation-architecture` Phase B gained a deploy-canary gate** (new step 16). After scaffolding completes, deploy a hello-world from the freshly scaffolded repo to the target environment. URL captured in `compass/config.yaml` under `ci_cd.deploy_canary_url`. If deploy fails, return to Phase A with an ADR entry naming the cause — the architecture doesn't actually deploy yet. Catches the "Turborepo + pnpm + Vercel doesn't compose; doubled output path; missing pnpm-lock; no Next.js detected" multi-round-debug failure mode that burns days mid-project.
- **New scanner check `PROD_READY-09`: Vendor capability claims unverified for deployment context** (High severity, suppressible with DRI). Every vendor feature the architecture depends on — DB extensions, region-specific services, plan-tier features, SDK capabilities — needs a doc citation that confirms availability for the *specific* deployment context (region, SKU, plan-tier, runtime version). Not "Supabase has it" if you mean "Supabase US-East has it." Catches the `pg_uuidv7 missing in ap-south-1` class of failure.
- `compass/config.yaml` `ci_cd` section gained `deploy_canary_url` field.

### Changed
- Phase B Verification gate updated to require deploy-canary green before workflow completes.
- Production Ready scanner check count: 8 → 9.

### Notes
- **Out of scope (per user):** the other 10 aura-app issues — Babel runtime / Metro module resolution / React 18 vs 19 / Expo SDK pinning / pnpm strict isolation interactions — are app-specific tooling choices, not Compass's concern.
- **Deferred:** "stack composition matrix" (issues #1, #2, #4, #5, #8 reveal a meta-pattern of foundational stack choices not composing). The deploy-canary gate catches most of this at integration time; revisit if it doesn't catch enough.
- **Same anti-pattern as v0.2.4:** load-bearing checks that weren't load-bearing in the spec. Fix shape is consistent — explicit constraint + verification gate + named anti-pattern.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-26

> Story template gained a Standard Experience Checklist after a missed back-button shipped in aura-app and led to a UX-cleanup mini-bet. Surfaced a Compass gap I initially miscategorized as "app-specific" — user correctly identified it as a story-AC structural omission.

### Added
- **`compass/templates/story.md` gained a "Standard Experience Checklist" section** between Acceptance Criteria and Tech notes. Six categories that PM must address when writing the story — each either covered by ≥1 AC item OR explicitly marked `n/a — <reason>`:
  - **Navigation** — back / exit / cancel / dismiss paths for every navigable surface
  - **States** — loading / empty / error / success / disabled each has an AC
  - **Feedback** — error type discrimination + success acknowledgment + destructive confirmation
  - **Accessibility** — focus management + keyboard nav + screen reader labels
  - **Edge cases** — offline / slow network / permissions-denied / missing-data
  - **Cross-surface consistency** (multi-target stacks) — behavior matches across surfaces
- Same `cite-or-mark-n/a` enforcement shape as Researcher 6-category, Architect 6-pillar, signal-consultation 5-category.

### Changed
- **`/create-story` step 7 now requires the Standard Experience Checklist filled** before the story can reach `status: ready`. Empty categories (no AC reference AND no `n/a` note) block the gate.
- **New refusal case in `/create-story`:** "Standard Experience Checklist has any empty category."
- **Designer role DoD** gained explicit "coordinate with PM on Standard Experience Checklist" — design completeness and story-AC completeness must match. If something's in the Figma but not in the AC, it ships missing.
- **UX Writer role DoD** gained explicit "error copy discriminates error type" — generic "something went wrong" or mislabelling validation as "network errors" fails the Feedback category.

### Fixed
- Closed the **story-AC-omission failure mode**: Designer drew the back button; the story's AC didn't say "back navigation present"; Engineer didn't implement; Codex E2E didn't test; shipped without. The new checklist makes "covered in design but missing from AC" structurally impossible at story-creation time.
- Closed the **error-message-quality omission**: aura-app's Passkey screen showed misleading "network" errors when the actual failure was passkey-specific. New checklist's Feedback category forces error-type discrimination in the AC, which forces Engineer to implement type-specific handling and UX Writer to draft type-specific copy.

### Notes
- **Aura-app trigger:** PM was correct that the UX cleanups weren't just "app-specific" — they revealed a structural gap in story AC completeness. I initially miscategorized; user corrected.
- **Out of scope (deferred from earlier triage rounds):** team playbooks signal-consultation category, stack-aware canary artifact, cross-story E2E pattern. Each warrants its own focused patch.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-05-26

> Two improvements promoted from earlier deferrals after the aura-app 2026-05-26 state-of-play update gave direct evidence both gaps were real.

### Added
- **Stack-aware canary artifacts.** `compass/config.yaml` `ci_cd.deploy_canary_url` (single string) → `ci_cd.canary_artifacts[]` (list of `{kind, url, verified_at, notes?}`). Kinds: `web | mobile | container | other`. Multi-target projects (web + mobile + service + …) now require one canary entry per target. Catches the "web canary green, mobile canary missing" failure mode that blocked aura-app's AC4 on the first feature bet.
- **Team playbooks signal-consultation category.** `/setup-foundation-architecture` step 6 signal consultation gained a 5th category — search `docs/playbooks/*` for prior stack-specific learnings; cite or mark `n/a — empty directory` (valid for first-project bootstrap). Mandatory citation once the team has accumulated playbooks across projects. Same `cite-or-mark-n/a` enforcement shape as the prior 4 categories (Researcher 6, Architect 6, signal-consultation now 5, story standard-experience 6 — **5th instance of the pattern; codify in AGENTS.md when a 6th lands**).
- **New `docs/playbooks/` convention** — per-stack-combo or per-topic learnings, distinct from per-bet runbooks and per-incident postmortems. Living artifacts; `last_validated` date bumped each re-use.
- **New template `compass/templates/playbook.md`** — frontmatter with `stack_combo` tags, `related_bets`, `last_validated`; sections: When this applies / Symptoms / Steps / Gotchas / References / Maintainer note.
- **`/measure` Phase 4 step 11a soft prompt** — when a bet's outcome resolves with notable technical learnings, prompt for playbook capture while the learning is freshest. Soft prompt, not gate.
- **Foundation architecture template** Boundaries/Scaffolding now creates `docs/playbooks/` as an empty directory (with a README pointing at the template). Stays empty until learnings accumulate.

### Changed
- **`/setup-foundation-architecture` Phase B step 16** rewritten from single-URL deploy-canary to **multi-target deploy canaries** — one per deploy target in the foundational stack. Phase B Verification updated to require every target in `canary_artifacts[]` with `verified_at` populated; partial coverage fails.
- **`/setup-foundation-architecture` Phase A Verification** updated: signal consultation is now 5 categories (was 4).

### Notes
- **aura-app evidence** for both improvements: AC4 dev-build sprint (Improvement 1); proposed 3 runbooks (`pnpm-monorepo-rn`, `vercel-pnpm-monorepo`, `expo-go-vs-dev-build`) framed as "captures today's learnings for the next Compass project" (Improvement 2).
- **Out of scope (still deferred):** cross-story E2E pattern; stack composition matrix; playbook-coverage scanner check.

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-26

> **Framework self-instrumenting.** First patch about Compass's own learning cadence rather than a specific workflow gap. Codifies the foundational pattern shaping ~70% of the framework's 15 prior improvements; institutes retro cadence; backfills 3 retros covering all prior work.

### Added
- **New `/retro` workflow + Scanner-role skill + `compass/templates/retro.md`.** Periodic batch retro of improvements, fires every 5 entries in `compass/workflows/improvements.md`. Reports patterns (positive), recurring anti-patterns (soft-spec-rationalization surfaces), convention candidates, drift signals, watch-for list. **Reports — does not prescribe.** No HITL gate.
- **New `compass/workflows/retros/` directory convention** — archived retros (`status: archive`, immutable once written).
- **Three backfilled retros covering improvements 1-15:**
  - Retro #001 (v0.1.8 → v0.1.12) — surfaced N-category, refuse-escalate, soft-spec-recipe as convention-ready at improvement #5.
  - Retro #002 (v0.1.13 → v0.2.2) — surfaced `status: living`, state-detection-table, auto-trigger-chain. Major capability expansion.
  - Retro #003 (v0.2.3 → v0.2.7) — confirmed soft-spec-rationalization at 18+ cumulative instances; flagged `/advance: 0 uses` drift signal; flagged aura-app trigger-origin concentration risk.
- **Three new cross-cutting principles in AGENTS.md** (now 16 principles, was 13):
  - **#14 (foundational): Soft spec → AI rationalization is a vulnerability surface, not flexibility.** User's verbatim formulation: *"Anywhere an AI agent has interpretive room, it will exercise judgment that diverges from intent. The fix is never 'tell the AI to be better' — it's explicit constraint + mechanical verification gate + named anti-pattern in the workflow file."* This is the foundational principle that #15 and #16 instantiate. ~18 instances across the framework's history. Worst convention-discovery lag observed (17 improvements between visible and codified).
  - **#15: N-category `cite-or-mark-n/a` enforcement** for structured consultation. 5+ instances (Researcher 6, Architect 6-pillar + 6-research, Architect signal 5-category, Story standard-experience 6, playbook frontmatter).
  - **#16: Refuse + escalate to upstream artifact.** 5+ instances (Researcher refuse, HITL before scaffold, data model before DB, bet-arch deviation gate, Story Standard Experience gates `status: ready`).
- **`compass/workflows/improvements.md` header** now tracks retro cadence + next-retro-fires-after counter (currently #20).

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md workflow count:** 17 → 18 (`/retro` added). Cross-cutting principle count: 13 → 16.

### Notes
- **Meta-observation:** The convention-discovery lag of v0.1.8 → v0.2.8 (17 improvements to name the dominant pattern) was the worst it will ever be. Every retro from here forward should shrink it.
- **The user's verbatim formulation is preserved in Principle #14.** The user crystallized the pattern more precisely than the framework had named it; honoring the wording maintains attribution and accuracy.
- **First *live* retro fires after improvement #20** (v0.2.8 is improvement #16; 4 more entries needed before automatic fire). The retro workflow as-written will meet reality then; today's backfilled retros are the proof-of-shape.
- **No new role added.** Retros are owned by Project Manager (for project retros) or framework-Architect persona (for framework retros — Compass on Compass). Existing roles cover the work.

## [0.3.0-alpha] — 2026-05-26

> **Two-part alpha for the v0.3 line.** Part 1: `/advance` deprecated (first retro-driven decision, framework subtracts surface). Part 2: workflow hardening template established + `/setup-product` translated as the first validation. Together these establish v0.3 as the *hardening-by-structure* line — every workflow eventually translates to the gate/work/postcondition template.

### Part 1 — `/advance` deprecated

> First action on a retro-surfaced drift signal. Convention-discovery lag = hours, not 17 improvements. Principle #14 applied recursively to framework design.

### Changed
- **`/advance` workflow deprecated.** Retro #003 (shipped in v0.2.8) flagged `/advance: 0 uses in aura-app over 4 days of active dev` as a drift signal. The framework was over-engineering a "canonical phase advance" command that real users don't invoke — phase transitions happen naturally via status-field flips, and the auto-trigger chain (`/advance` → `/plan` → `/scan` → `/dashboard`) was load-bearing in the spec but irrelevant in practice. **This is itself an instance of Principle #14 applied to framework design** — the framework designer rationalized that a canonical advance command was needed; reality showed it wasn't.
- **`compass/workflows/advance.md`** rewritten with deprecation notice at top + migration table + historical Process section preserved for archaeology. Skill registered (don't fail silently) but the workflow now prints the migration table on invocation rather than performing any phase advance, scan, or refresh.
- **Auto-chain references removed** from active surface across `/plan`, `/scan`, `/dashboard`, `/status`, `/create-bet-portfolio`, `/build`, Project Manager role, Scanner role, scan-report template, brief template, plan template, and `/plan` + `/scan` skill descriptions. What remains independent of `/advance`: `/build` phase-boundary auto-invocation of `/scan`; `/dashboard` auto-refresh from `/scan` + `/plan` + `/metrics` + `/status`; cron-driven `/scan` per `compass/config.yaml`.
- **AGENTS.md workflow table:** 18 → 17 (removed `/advance` row).
- **README.md flow diagram:** removed the "Navigate" bucket (which had `/advance` as its only member); now 4 buckets (Bootstrap / Plan / Execute / Observe). Added note: phase transitions are direct `status:` field flips — no canonical "advance" command.
- **CLAUDE.md + SETUP.md:** removed `/advance` references.

### Migration

| What you used to do | What to do now |
|---|---|
| `/advance` to move to next phase | Flip the artifact's `status:` field directly (`proposed` → `approved` → `in-build` → `shipped` → etc.) |
| `/advance` to refresh the plan | `/plan` directly |
| `/advance` to run the scanner | `/scan <bet-id>` directly (auto-invoked at `/build` phase boundaries) |
| `/advance` to refresh the dashboard | `/dashboard` directly (auto-invoked by `/scan`, `/plan`, `/metrics`, `/status`) |
| `/advance` to see current state | `/status` directly (auto-refreshes `/dashboard`) |

### Notes
- **No replacement command.** The whole insight from the drift signal is that this command was unneeded. Replacing it with a renamed equivalent would re-introduce the same loophole.
- **Drift-signal-to-action lag = hours.** Retro #003 (shipped 2026-05-26) → v0.3.0-alpha (same day). The retro cadence's promised lag-shrinking is real on its first try.
- **Files NOT touched:** all 3 retro archives, historical CHANGELOG entries (v0.1.14 through v0.2.8), historical improvements.md entries — they reference `/advance` as an active workflow because it *was* active when they were written. Editing history retroactively would violate the archive-immutability convention established for retros.
- **`scanner.per_phase` config + `blocking_advance` field on scan reports retained** — they're informational signal for users reading scan reports, not enforcement mechanisms tied to `/advance`. The user (or `/build`) consumes them to decide whether to advance.

### Part 2 — Workflow hardening template + framework grounding + `/setup-product` translated (first validation)

### Added
- **Workflow hardening template established.** New `compass/templates/workflow-template.md` defines the gate/work/postcondition structure every v0.3+ workflow adopts. Sections: Header (status / owner / auto_invokes / invoked_by / version) · **Framework grounding** · Purpose · Workflow-level Preconditions (GATE) · Roles invoked · Steps as gate/work/postcondition triplets · Verification checklist (final GATE) · Output summary contract · Notes (anti-patterns + edge cases + migration). Template includes inline `<!-- … -->` commentary so future translators inherit intent.
- **New required template section: Framework grounding.** Every v0.3+ workflow cites the canonical frameworks it operationalizes (industry standards with year + source; books with author/title/year; Compass-originals honestly labeled; cross-cutting principles enforced). Anchors each workflow's gates in auditable lineage rather than ad-hoc invention.
- **`compass/framework/canon.md` created** — reference doc with one-paragraph entries for canonical frameworks Compass cites. Sectioned: Strategy/discovery foundations · Competitive position · Bet-based commitment · Communication discipline · Goal-setting · Compass-original patterns. Short-form citations from workflows (`[working-backwards]`, `[helmer-7-powers]`, `[okrs]`, etc.) resolve to canon entries.
- **`/setup-product` hardened as first translation.** `compass/workflows/setup-product.md` rewritten to template shape with full Framework grounding section. **Structural change only — same steps, same artifacts, same HITL gates, same refusal cases.** Implicit preconditions made explicit; missing postconditions added; Verification items reference Principles #14 / #15 / #16 specifically.
- **`AGENTS.md` new section "Workflow structure"** — explains the gate/work/postcondition pattern, points at `compass/templates/workflow-template.md` as canonical, articulates the hardening rollout, **and codifies the density-based budget**: hardened workflows checked by load-bearing density (≥ 1 per ~4 lines), not raw length.

### Changed
- **Hardening budget recalibrated from raw length to load-bearing density.** Original heuristic ("hardened workflow ≤ 40% longer; 2x = hard fail") was a proxy that didn't survive first contact: hardened `/setup-product` is **161 lines = 2.24x original (72 lines)**, but **density rose from 1 per 3.6 lines (original) to 1 per 3.2 lines (hardened)**. Raw length grew because new sections (Framework grounding, Roles invoked, per-step Postconditions, Migration) added load-bearing content — not ceremony. The recalibrated check: does each line earn its place by adding mechanically-checkable constraint, named convention, or auditable lineage? Density measure documented in AGENTS.md "Workflow structure" and `compass/workflows/improvements.md`.

### Notes
- **`/setup-product` picked first** because it was already the most-disciplined workflow (had Verification gate from v0.1.9, named anti-patterns inline). Low translation risk → ideal for validating the template on the easy case before harder workflows (`/build`, `/create-brief`) translate.
- **No behavior changes.** Diff against v0.2.8 setup-product confirms: same 9 steps in the same order, same artifacts (`docs/foundation/product.md` + optional `docs/foundation/research.md` + `docs/status.md` update), same HITL gate, same refusal cases (now expressed as workflow-level Preconditions).
- **`canon.md` is reference material, not an essay.** Each framework gets one paragraph (name, originator, year, one-sentence contribution). Additions follow the same shape.
- **v0.3 hardening rollout will proceed one workflow per session, deliberate pace** — per the slow-pace commitment from this conversation. Next candidate likely `/create-brief` (less disciplined, tests template against weaker baseline + against the density measure on a different workflow shape).

## [0.3.12] — 2026-06-02

> **v0.4 spec target crystallized: Delivery Manager + Time/Quality/Finance + moat-layer positioning + 4 sub-problems named.** No framework code changes — this is **architectural-direction capture before the new project starts** (the project becomes the friction-discovery vehicle that informs which sub-problem to tackle first). Compass's v0.4 work concentrates on the orchestration layer; the moat is the integration (declarative workflows + filesystem-as-state + cross-host dispatch + surface-aware role-task fit + discipline-as-orchestration-input). **No other framework combines these.**

### Added

- v0.4 architectural-direction crystallization in `compass/workflows/improvements.md` (entry below). Names the **Delivery Manager** role evolution, the **Time / Quality / Finance** mandate, the **moat positioning**, and the **4 sub-problems** to solve under-the-surface (cross-host task dispatch · state synchronization · real-time cost tracking · HITL gate routing). Implementation scope estimated at ~6-8 framework files + per-host watcher implementations; not a 6-month rebuild — **3-4 design sessions + implementation sessions within v0.3.x cadence territory** once new-project friction signals validate sub-problem priorities.

### Notes

- **No Compass-original codified** — pure architectural-direction capture. Catalog unchanged at 6 shapes / 11 patterns. **New release class introduced: architectural-direction crystallization** joins the existing release-class taxonomy (Compass-original codification · infrastructure release · PR correction · same-day correction · artifact-pruning release · architectural-direction crystallization). **6 distinct release classes** as of v0.3.12.
- **Counter ticks to #29** because architectural-direction commitments are substantive — they constrain future framework evolution and inform what gets shipped at v0.4. Similar shape to a Compass-original codification (commits the framework to a specific direction) but without immediate framework-file changes.
- **The new project is the friction-discovery vehicle.** Pre-emptive v0.4 implementation work would be soft-spec-rationalization (Principle #14). Manual orchestration during new-project usage will surface which sub-problem causes the most friction → that becomes the v0.4 implementation priority. User IS Delivery Manager today; v0.4 automates that role.
- **Delivery Manager mandate is mutually exclusive with content decisions** — Time / Quality / Finance only. What to build (PM/Product), how to architect (Architect), how to implement (Engineer), what's a bug (Reviewer) all stay with their respective roles. **No authority creep risk by design.** This is structurally distinct from "Project Manager evolved to include orchestration" — Delivery Manager is a sharper role mandate (three measurable axes; three reportable surfaces; three places the user can override).
- **The moat framing is now explicit.** Methodology + markdown + roles is widely replicable; orchestration layer is what Compass differentiates on. The integration (filesystem as state · declarative workflow as orchestration spec · cross-host role dispatch · surface-aware role-task fit · discipline-as-orchestration-input) is what no other framework combines. **Compass's strategic positioning is now an engineering commitment, not just methodology.**
- **v0.3.x line continues during v0.4 design phase.** v0.4 doesn't block v0.3.x; methodology + markdown + filesystem layer continue working; orchestration is additive when ready. Likely v0.3.x ships 5-10 more incremental codifications + infrastructure pieces while v0.4 design + implementation runs in parallel. **Retro #006 should examine** whether v0.3.x cadence holds, slips, or naturally collapses into v0.4 work.
- **3 of 5 Retro #005 recommendations now acted on across v0.3.9-v0.3.11; v0.3.12 adds the v0.4 spec capture as the 4th retro-driven action.** Remaining 2 deferred: `[framework-on-framework]` codification (3 instances past threshold) and `setup-agent.py` propagation script (small scope post v0.3.8 correction).
- **Cadence note.** v0.3.1 → v0.3.12 = **12 sessions across 9 Compass-originals + 1 infrastructure release + 1 artifact-pruning release + 1 architectural-direction crystallization + corrections.** Cadence broke from strict-Compass-original-per-session early (v0.3.7 infrastructure); v0.3.12 confirms the broader framing: **substantive-progress-per-session, where "substantive" includes new release classes as they emerge.**
- **Codification candidate when v0.4 ships:** `[moat-as-integration]` or `[orchestration-as-differentiation]` — a strategic/positioning pattern, distinct from existing 6 shapes. Worth retro examination after v0.4's first 3-5 real projects to see whether the integration actually feels differentiated or whether the framing was over-claimed.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-06-02

> **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` pruned per Retro #005 artifact analysis (rated 7/10).** Three structural changes targeting per-Codex-review cognitive cost without losing v0.3.6 codification value: (1) **Step 0 gains a decision tree at the top** — pure-logic PRs skip the framework-registration check entirely; framework-discovered surfaces continue to the detailed checks. (2) **Step 4 scoped to NEW load-bearing claims** — already-verified claims within their `last_verified` window inherit prior verification; the operational-cost failure mode the freshness-check pattern was designed to AVOID is now explicitly named. (3) **Anti-patterns consolidated from 9 → 7** — `direct-import-test-suspicious` and `narrow-bug-focus` folded into `polished-but-broken` as concrete sub-examples; their separate identity didn't add signal beyond what `polished-but-broken` already encompassed. **Not a Compass-original codification** — pure artifact cleanup. Every Codex review now pays a smaller reading cost.

### Changed

- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` Step 0** — added decision tree skipping framework-registration check for pure-logic PRs. Detail-block compressed (removed "REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL" tail since decision tree handles that gating). Cross-references `polished-but-broken` instead of separately naming `direct-import-test-suspicious`.
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` Step 4** — scoped from "every load-bearing framework claim" to "NEW load-bearing claims only" (claims not already verified in prior PRs against the same external source, OR claims whose `last_verified` window has expired). Names the operational-cost failure mode explicitly: "re-verifying every load-bearing claim on every PR is the operational-cost failure mode the freshness-check pattern is designed to AVOID, not perpetuate."
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` Anti-patterns section** — consolidated 9 → 7. `direct-import-test-suspicious` and `narrow-bug-focus` now live as concrete sub-examples under `polished-but-broken` (they're failure modes that share the same diagnostic shape: mechanical artifact inspection closes the gap). Story-claim-trust anti-pattern preserved separately because it's structurally distinct (about NEW claims at Step 4 review-time freshness, not framework registration). Original 5 anti-patterns unchanged.

### Notes

- **No Compass-original codified — pure artifact cleanup.** Catalog unchanged at 6 shapes / 11 patterns. Counter ticks to #28 because the change is substantive (Retro #005 surfaced it as actionable; structural pruning of a load-bearing artifact); maintenance bumps (e.g., the `last_verified` bump after Codex v0.136.0 verification) don't tick the counter.
- **Retro #005 artifact analysis acted on within 4 sessions.** Rated reviewer.md 7/10; recommendations: trim Step 0, scope Step 4, consolidate anti-patterns. All three actioned in v0.3.11. **First artifact-pruning release** triggered by retro artifact analysis (vs. by friction or codification readiness).
- **What was preserved:**
  - The codified `[mechanical-output-verification]` Step 0 framework-registration check (decision tree adds conditional gating but doesn't remove the substance)
  - The codified `[freshness-check]` Step 4 review-time application (now scoped to NEW claims — same pattern, sharper scope)
  - The four named anti-patterns (`polished-but-broken` parent + `direct-import-test-suspicious` and `narrow-bug-focus` as sub-examples; Story-claim-trust kept separate)
  - All freshness markers and the "Expected Codex output shape" contract
  - All other Steps 1-3, 5-7 and the Hard rules section
- **What was reduced:**
  - Step 0 reading cost on pure-logic PRs: decision tree exits at the top
  - Step 4 operational cost: scope limited to NEW claims rather than every load-bearing claim
  - Anti-patterns reading cost: 9 → 7 with semantic consolidation (sub-examples rather than separate items)
- **Expected impact** — every Codex review pays a smaller reading cost; framework-discovered-surface checks remain rigorous when they apply; review-time freshness check stops being an operational deterrent (the failure mode Principle #14 warns about — soft specs that get rationalized under pressure). **Watch for whether `polished-but-broken` recurrence rate stays the same after consolidation** — if it rises, the consolidation under-named the failure modes; if stable or falls, the consolidation captured the right semantic level.
- **Retro #005 deferred recommendations status:** (a) `[declare-not-implement]` codification ✅ v0.3.9; (b) `[hard-line-declaration]` codification ✅ v0.3.10; (c) reviewer.md pruning ✅ v0.3.11; (d) `[framework-on-framework]` codification — still deferred (3 instances past threshold); (e) `setup-agent.py` propagation script — still deferred. **3 of 5 acted on in 3 consecutive sessions.** Retro-to-release pipeline working as designed.
- **Cadence note.** v0.3.1 → v0.3.11 = **11 sessions, 9 Compass-originals + 1 infrastructure release (v0.3.7) + 1 PR correction (PR #1) + 1 same-day correction (v0.3.8 adapter-upstream) + 1 artifact-pruning release (v0.3.11)**. One-Compass-original-per-session cadence broken twice now (v0.3.7 infrastructure, v0.3.11 artifact-pruning) — both legitimate non-codification work surfaced by the retro cycle. The cadence isn't strict-Compass-original-only; it's substantive-progress-per-session.

## [0.3.10] — 2026-06-02

> **`[hard-line-declaration]` codified as 2nd scope-discipline class member.** When Compass commits to shipping something in a future release, the commitment gets **explicit slip-counters + named consequences** in CHANGELOG entries and `compass/workflows/improvements.md` headers — creating structural pressure that overcomes the diffuse "next substantive release is more important" rationalization. **Two instances at codification:** (1) freshness detection 3-slip → v0.3.7 ship (v0.3.6 CHANGELOG declared "if it slips a 4th time, the workflow-side defense must be re-examined"; v0.3.7 shipped ON TIME). (2) Retro cadence 2-slip → Retro #005 on time (Retro #004 declared "if retro slips again, retro rationalization is no longer one-off"; Retro #005 fired ON TIME at improvement #25). **Catalog grows from 6 shapes / 10 patterns → 6 shapes / 11 patterns.** Scope-discipline class grows from 1 → 2 members — **the new shape introduced in v0.3.9 is now structurally validated, not a one-off.**

### Added

- **New `[hard-line-declaration]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. Names the pattern + mechanical three-part structure (counter visibility + named consequence + structural pressure) + the 2 instances accumulated + classification as scope-discipline 2nd member + anti-pattern closed (`commitment-drift`) + distinction from Principle #16 refuse-escalate (within-workflow vs across-releases scope) + tracking note ("worth tracking how often the pattern fires successfully in future release-planning sessions").
- **`AGENTS.md` Workflow Structure section** restructured for the scope-discipline class — top paragraph explains the class as a whole (Compass's own scope at framework design time, distinct from workflow-execution shapes); subsequent paragraphs document each member (`[declare-not-implement]` then `[hard-line-declaration]`). Catalog count updated to 6 shapes / 11 patterns; ratio 9 workflow-execution : 2 scope-discipline.

### Changed

- **Compass-originals catalog grows from 10 → 11 patterns; 6 shapes unchanged.** Scope-discipline class: 1 → 2 members. Workflow-execution patterns total 9 (unchanged). Ratio shifts from 9:1 → 9:2. **Worth examining in Retro #006 whether the workflow-execution:scope-discipline ratio continues to hold or whether scope-discipline grows further.** Forward candidates named in canon: orchestrator selection (v0.4+); consumer distribution (v0.4+).

### Notes

- **Codification rule satisfied — 2 structurally-distinct instances.** (1) freshness detection commitment slipped through 3 versions before v0.3.6's hard-line-in-CHANGELOG declaration produced an on-time v0.3.7 ship. (2) retro-cadence slipped through 2 cycles before Retro #004's hard-line declaration produced an on-time Retro #005. Both surfaced in Retro #005 codification readiness ranking; v0.3.10 acts on the 2nd recommendation after v0.3.9 acted on the 1st.
- **Scope-discipline class structurally validated.** v0.3.9 introduced the shape; v0.3.10 confirms it's not a one-off. Both members govern framework-design-time scope decisions; both fire during release planning rather than workflow execution; both have user as load-bearing oversight (the framework's reflex is real but not infallible). **The class as an organizing axis is meaningful** — workflow-execution and scope-discipline patterns serve different audiences (workflow executors vs framework contributors) and fire at different times (workflow run vs release planning).
- **Anti-pattern named: `commitment-drift`.** When Compass commits to a future release and lets it slip silently, the commitment drifts indefinitely. Each individual slip is defensible ("substantive work is more important than this commitment"); the cumulative pattern is rationalization. `[hard-line-declaration]` is the structural countermeasure: name the consequence explicitly in a load-bearing visible place so the next slip can't be silent. **Worth tracking application frequency** — each on-time ship after a declared hard line is a successful application; each slip past a declared consequence is data that the pattern needs sharpening.
- **Cadence: 10 sessions running.** v0.3.1 → v0.3.10 = 10 sessions, 9 Compass-originals + 1 infrastructure release (v0.3.7) + 1 PR correction (PR #1) + 1 same-day correction (v0.3.8 adapter-upstream). **One-Compass-original-per-session cadence holds for 10 sessions running** — exactly the pattern `[hard-line-declaration]` is designed to enforce, applied implicitly to the cadence commitment itself.
- **Retro #005 deferred recommendations status update:** (a) `[declare-not-implement]` codification ✅ shipped v0.3.9; (b) `[hard-line-declaration]` codification ✅ shipped v0.3.10; (c) `[framework-on-framework]` codification (3 instances past threshold) — still deferred to v0.3.11+; (d) `compass/roles/reviewer.md` pruning — still deferred to v0.3.11+; (e) `compass/scripts/setup-agent.py` propagation script — still deferred to v0.3.11+. **2 of 5 Retro #005 recommendations acted on in 2 consecutive sessions.** Counter ticks to #27; next retro fires after #30 (3 more substantive improvements needed).
- **Recursive observation: the improvements.md "Next retro fires after #30" counter is itself an instance of `[hard-line-declaration]`** that v0.3.10 just codified. The counter mechanism that has been carrying the retro cadence is the pattern being named. Framework retroactively recognizing what it's been doing. **3rd instance arguably** (but only the 2 explicit "hard line" declarations are cited in the canon entry; the counter mechanism is the implicit form). Worth noting in next retro whether the implicit counter form should be considered a 3rd instance for codification-confidence purposes.

## [0.3.9] — 2026-06-02

> **`[declare-not-implement]` codified as 1st scope-discipline class Compass-original — introduces the 6th pattern shape.** When Compass would need to build an integration with external tools/agents/services, it **declares the pattern + registry + manual fallback; does NOT write the integration itself.** Upstream libraries, vendor CLIs, or consumer-side wiring handle actual integrations. **Two instances at codification:** (1) v0.3.5 `[agent-handoff]` — declared 5-piece handoff shape + shipped template with 4 commented reviewer blocks; consumer wires per-CLI integration. (2) v0.3.8 same-day correction — declared `agents:` registry + delegated API-based-agent adapter layer to LiteLLM / Vercel AI SDK / OpenRouter / LangChain; refused to ship per-agent adapter docs that would duplicate upstream. **Catalog now spans 6 shapes / 10 patterns** (enforcement 4 · interaction 1 · freshness 1 · observability 1 · handoff 2 · **scope-discipline 1**). First Compass-original that governs **framework design-time scope** rather than workflow execution.

### Added

- **New `[declare-not-implement]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. Names the pattern, the 2 instances accumulated, the `integration-creep` anti-pattern it closes, the "applied at framework design time not workflow execution time" framing, the "user as load-bearing oversight" honesty about framework fallibility, and the forward-compatibility note (future scope-discipline candidates: orchestrator selection v0.4+; consumer distribution v0.4+).
- **`AGENTS.md` Workflow Structure section gained scope-discipline pattern note** — names it as the 6th pattern shape (first non-workflow-execution shape), cites both instances, names the `integration-creep` anti-pattern, names user as load-bearing oversight.
- **`compass/templates/workflow-template.md` gained inline `SCOPE-DISCIPLINE` commentary block** — gives workflow authors a heuristic ("would this duplicate upstream work?") for invoking the pattern when about to add per-X documentation or adapter code.

### Changed

- **Compass-originals catalog grows from 5 shapes / 9 patterns → 6 shapes / 10 patterns.** Scope-discipline (1 — `[declare-not-implement]`) joins enforcement (4) · interaction (1) · freshness (1) · observability (1) · handoff (2). Workflow-execution shapes total 9; scope-discipline (framework-design shape) totals 1. **Worth examining in Retro #006 (after improvement #30) whether the workflow-execution/scope-discipline split holds or whether scope-discipline grows additional members.** Forward candidates named explicitly: orchestrator selection + consumer distribution.

### Notes

- **Codification rule satisfied — 2 structurally-distinct instances.** (1) v0.3.5 `[agent-handoff]` reviewer-CLI parameterization without per-CLI integrations. (2) v0.3.8 same-day adapter-upstream correction delegating to LiteLLM-class libraries. Both surfaced in Retro #005 codification readiness ranking. **Top retro recommendation acted on within next-session cycle** — same shape as v0.3.6 codifying `[mechanical-output-verification]` after Retro #004's surfacing.
- **First Compass-original whose audience is framework contributors, not workflow executors.** The pattern fires when Compass's own scope is being decided (release planning, codification, roadmap deferrals). Unlike enforcement / interaction / freshness / observability / handoff — which fire during workflow runs — `[declare-not-implement]` fires during framework-evolution work. This is a meaningful structural distinction; the canon entry + AGENTS.md note + workflow-template inline commentary all explicitly call it out.
- **Anti-pattern named: `integration-creep`.** Integration surfaces expand linearly; Compass-maintainer scope does not. The result of unchecked `integration-creep` is stale Compass docs, brittle Compass adapters, and a framework whose maintenance burden grows past its sustainable size. `[declare-not-implement]` is the structural countermeasure. **Worth tracking how often the pattern fires in future release-planning sessions** — each catch is a successful application; each miss (user catching it) is data for the load-bearing-oversight observation.
- **User as load-bearing oversight is preserved explicitly.** v0.3.8 same-day correction was caught by user, not by the framework's own discipline. The canon entry names this honestly: "the framework's `[declare-not-implement]` reflex is real but not infallible; user judgment is part of the system." Future v0.4+ multi-agent architecture must preserve this user-as-oversight role; orchestrator agency does not replace it. **First Compass-original that explicitly names user judgment as part of the structural system** — prior originals named user as approver (HITL gates) or arbiter (PM disputes), but not as load-bearing oversight against framework's own scope creep.
- **No new infrastructure shipping** — v0.3.9 is a pure pattern-codification release, similar shape to v0.3.6 (`[mechanical-output-verification]`). Smaller file count than v0.3.7 (freshness detection infrastructure) or v0.3.8 (registry + reframing). Per the cadence: **8 sessions / 8 Compass-originals + 1 infrastructure release.** Cadence holds; one-Compass-original-per-session pattern recurs.
- **Retro #005 recommendations not-yet-acted-on (deferred to next sessions):** (a) `[hard-line-declaration]` codification — 2 instances accumulated, ready; deferred to v0.3.10+ unless user prioritizes earlier; (b) `[framework-on-framework]` codification — 3 instances past threshold; ready on owner discretion; (c) `compass/roles/reviewer.md` pruning per artifact analysis (Step 0 decision tree, Step 4 scope to NEW claims, consolidate 10 anti-patterns → 5-6); (d) propagation script `compass/scripts/setup-agent.py` for CLI-agent prompt directories (was originally v0.3.9 commitment per v0.3.8 same-day correction, but user picked codification over script). **All carried forward as v0.3.10+ candidates.** Counter ticks to #26; next retro fires after improvement #30 (4 more substantive improvements needed).

## [0.3.8] — 2026-06-02

> **`[agent-agnostic-role-assignment]` codified as 2nd handoff-class Compass-original + `compass/config.yaml` gains `agents:` registry + `defaults:` + per-role `tool_assignments` validated against the registry.** Generalizes the `[agent-handoff]` v0.3.5 pattern (agent-agnostic for reviewer only) to **every role**. 8 supported agents in initial registry: `claude`, `codex`, `openai` (ChatGPT/GPT API), `gemini`, `deepseek`, `codestral`, `apple` (honestly marked `unsupported: true`), `custom`. Defaults match pre-v0.3.8 behavior (Claude implements, Codex reviews) — no behavior change at ship; migration is opt-in via 1-line `tool_assignments` edit per role.

### Added

- **New `[agent-agnostic-role-assignment]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. Names the pattern + the 8 supported agents in initial registry + the codification rationale (2nd structurally-distinct instance of agent-agnosticism — reviewer-only in v0.3.5, generalized to all roles in v0.3.8).
- **`compass/config.yaml` gained `agents:` registry block** — each agent declares its `invocation` pattern (`cli` / `api` / `manual`), `context_loading` convention (`local-files` / `api-system-prompt` / `manual-paste`), `auth_env` (API key env var), `maturity` flag, and a brief `note:` describing the integration path. Apple Intelligence flagged `unsupported: true` with documented reason (system-level features, no open API for arbitrary role-playing) — honest rather than faked.
- **`compass/config.yaml` gained `defaults:` block** — `implements: claude`, `reviews: codex`, `product: claude`, `tech-writes: claude`. Categorizes roles by job-shape; serves as fallback when `tool_assignments` doesn't enumerate a role. Matches Compass's empirically-validated Claude+Codex split per AGENTS.md "Tool division of labor" structural rationale.
- **`compass/config.yaml` `tool_assignments:` validated against the registry** — comments mark which `defaults:` category each role falls under; structural constraint (`reviewer` and `security_reviewer` must use different model than implementer) explicit in the comment.
- **`AGENTS.md` "Tool division of labor" reframed** — from hardcoded `Claude | All roles EXCEPT...` + `Codex | Reviewer, Security Reviewer` to a registry table (8 agents with maturity flags) + a defaults table (4 role categories) + structural rationale for the reviewer-must-be-different-model constraint + override examples. **First of the 10 hardcoding files to derive from config** (per the `[agent-agnostic-role-assignment]` canon entry's deferred-to-v0.3.9/v0.3.10 propagation roadmap).
- **`compass/templates/workflow-template.md` gained inline commentary** on `[agent-agnostic-role-assignment]` — workflow steps that load a role can now reference `tool_assignments` for which agent plays it; the registry shape is forward-compatible with the v0.4+ orchestrator vision.
- **`README.md` "Core ideas" — Claude+Codex line updated** to "Agent-agnostic by design; defaults built in" with the registry agents enumerated. Preserves the "default = Claude implements, Codex reviews" framing for the empirical validation argument.
- **`SETUP.md` gained "Picking which agent plays which role" section** — step-by-step override guide with an example showing ChatGPT for PM + Gemini for designer + Claude for engineer + Codex for reviewer. Names the reviewer-different-model constraint inline. Also notes that non-default agents may require manual prompt-directory setup until v0.3.10 propagation script ships.

### Changed

- **Compass-originals catalog balance shifts.** Before v0.3.8: 4 enforcement : 4 usability (interaction · freshness · observability · handoff). After v0.3.8: **4 enforcement : 5 usability** (interaction · freshness · observability · 2 handoff). The handoff class gains a 2nd member; usability shapes now slightly outpace enforcement. **Worth examining in next `/retro` as drift signal** — was 5:4 enforcement-lean (v0.3.6's `[mechanical-output-verification]` codification); v0.3.7 (infrastructure release, no new Compass-original) preserved balance; v0.3.8 swings to 5-usability lean. Whether this signals framework bias toward "make itself usable" over "make itself harder to violate" is a retro question.
- **Roadmap clarification (corrected same-day, see Notes).** v0.3.8 ships L1 (pattern + registry + defaults). **L2 (per-agent adapter docs at `compass/agents/<agent>.md`) is NOT shipping — Compass uses upstream adapter libraries instead** (LiteLLM recommended; Vercel AI SDK / OpenRouter / LangChain alternatives). Writing per-agent adapter docs would duplicate upstream documentation. **What was previously L3 becomes the new L2 (v0.3.9 candidate):** `compass/scripts/setup-agent.py` propagation script reading `tool_assignments` and generating per-agent prompt directories for **CLI-based agents only** (`.codex/prompts/`, `.gemini/prompts/`) — API-based agents go through the upstream adapter with `compass/roles/<role>.md` as system prompt, no per-agent prompt directory needed. The 3-surface drift resolution becomes smaller scope as a result.

### Notes

- **Codification rule satisfied — 2 structurally-distinct instances.** (1) `[agent-handoff]` v0.3.5 = agent-agnostic for one role (reviewer) via the GitHub Actions template's 4 commented blocks. (2) v0.3.8 = agent-agnostic for all roles via the config-driven registry. Same shape (pattern + registry + manual fallback documented), generalized scope. Same shape as `[mechanical-output-verification]` v0.3.6's codification path (2 instances accumulated, codification ready).
- **Per-agent maturity honestly named in registry.** `claude` + `codex` + `gemini` = production CLI integrations. `openai` + `deepseek` + `codestral` = API-mature (no first-party CLI matching Codex/Claude depth). `apple` = explicitly `unsupported: true` with documented reason — Apple Intelligence is system-level (Writing Tools, Summarization) without an open API for arbitrary role-playing. The pattern lists it for visibility while being honest about its limitations.
- **No behavior change at ship.** Defaults match pre-v0.3.8 Claude+Codex split. Existing consumers (aura-app, crypto-app) continue to work without edits. Migration to non-default agents is opt-in via `tool_assignments` edits.
- **3-surface drift resolution is in-progress, not complete.** AGENTS.md "Tool division of labor" now derives from `compass/config.yaml` registry (first of 10 hardcoding files). Other 9 (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SETUP.md`, `.claude/skills/build/SKILL.md`, `.codex/prompts/reviewer.md`, `.codex/prompts/security-reviewer.md`, `compass/framework/canon.md`, `compass/workflows/build.md`, `compass/workflows/fix.md`) update over v0.3.9 + v0.3.10 as L2/L3 land.
- **Orchestrator vision deferred to v0.4+.** User raised the architectural reframing mid-planning: "ideally there should be an orchestrator agent in the list that runs point and controls — something like what came out in Claude's latest version of dynamic workflows. Ideally each workflow is a different agent type." This is a fundamental Compass rearchitecture (methodology + markdown → multi-agent system + orchestrator + workflow-agents) and was explicitly deferred. **v0.3.8's `agents:` registry shape is forward-compatible with this vision** — naturally extends to declare an `orchestrator` entry; per-workflow-agent declarations follow the same shape as per-tool-agent declarations. Key questions for v0.4/v0.5: unit of agency (per-workflow vs per-role vs hybrid); where orchestrator runs (Compass-side declarative vs runtime-layer); what "controlling" means (just routing vs full conductor); how Compass principles #14/#15/#16 survive as agent constitutions; cost/latency reality of multi-agent invocation; MVP shape; lock-in risk (Claude Agent SDK vs generic abstraction).
- **First time an architectural-rearchitecture decision was explicitly deferred AND framing-captured rather than silently dropped or implicitly absorbed.** Worth surfacing in next `/retro` as positive pattern — deferral with framework-on-framework reasoning preserved.
- **Cadence note.** v0.3.1 → v0.3.6 = 6 sessions, 6 Compass-originals shipped (one per session). v0.3.7 = infrastructure release (freshness detection), no new Compass-original — first cadence break, legitimate. v0.3.8 = **back to one-Compass-original-per-session cadence** with `[agent-agnostic-role-assignment]`. 7 Compass-originals total across v0.3.x line.
- **Improvement counter at #25 — Retro #005 fires as side-effect.** This is the cadence-promised retro after #20. Should specifically examine: (1) catalog balance shift to 5-usability lean — bias signal or natural emergence? (2) v0.3.6 → PR#1 correction → v0.3.7 → v0.3.8 trajectory — what pattern? (3) whether "infrastructure releases" (v0.3.7) and "Compass-original releases" (v0.3.8) should be tracked separately in cadence accounting. (4) the orchestrator deferral as the framework's first explicit architectural-rearchitecture deferral with reasoning preserved — pattern or one-off?
- **Same-day correction (2026-06-02): adapter layer is upstream, not Compass-side.** Per user direction: "we are not creating per agent adapter we will use an existing adapter like litellm and other competitors for the adapters." The originally-planned L2 (per-agent adapter docs at `compass/agents/<agent>.md`) is **not a Compass deliverable** — it would duplicate upstream documentation. **LiteLLM** is the recommended adapter for API-based agents (`openai`, `deepseek`, `codestral`); **Vercel AI SDK**, **OpenRouter**, and **LangChain** are documented alternatives. For full-agent CLIs (`claude` via Claude Code, `codex` via Codex CLI, `gemini` via Gemini CLI), the CLI tool IS the adapter — no upstream library needed. Registry entries for API-based agents gained an `adapter: litellm` field + updated `note:` referencing LiteLLM model strings (e.g., `openai/gpt-5`, `deepseek/deepseek-chat`, `mistral/codestral-latest`). **Forward roadmap simplified:** v0.3.9 becomes the (smaller-scoped) propagation script for CLI-agent prompt directories only — was previously planned as v0.3.10's work. Compass becoming smaller, not bigger, by leveraging upstream adapters — **same shape as v0.3.5's `[agent-handoff]`**, which parameterized over reviewer CLIs without writing per-CLI integrations. Worth surfacing in next `/retro` as positive scope-discipline pattern: the framework's reflex to declare patterns rather than build implementations stays intact when the user reality-checks scope. **First v0.3.x release with a same-day correction to the deferred roadmap (not just to the substance)** — distinct from v0.3.5's same-day extension (3 implementation lessons) and v0.3.6's PR#1 correction (Next 16 anchor); this is a roadmap-shape correction.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-06-01

> **Freshness detection shipped — pull-bridge round 2 closes the 3-slip commitment.** `compass/scripts/check-freshness.py` (single-file Python 3 stdlib) walks `compass/` for files with `last_verified:` frontmatter, queries external sources via GitHub API or HTTP Last-Modified, auto-bumps where source is unchanged, flags otherwise. `.github/workflows/freshness-check.yml` runs the script weekly on the Compass repo itself. First-run validation immediately surfaced real value — `compass/roles/reviewer.md` flagged because Codex GitHub had a release on 2026-06-01 (same day as ship), suggesting the documented review format may need re-verification. **Closes the freshness-detection commitment after 3 consecutive slips** (v0.3.4 → v0.3.5+ → v0.3.6+). Multi-consumer reality observed during planning (aura-app at v0.2.x + crypto-app at v0.3.x with no sync mechanism) strengthens round-3 (distribution, v0.4+) deferral.

### Added

- **`compass/scripts/check-freshness.py`** — single-file Python 3 stdlib script. Walks `compass/` for files with `last_verified:` frontmatter; for each, queries the file's `external_source`:
  - **GitHub repo URLs** (e.g., `https://github.com/openai/codex`) → GitHub API `/releases/latest` (primary) · `/tags` (fallback) · `/commits` (last-resort)
  - **Generic URLs** → HTTP HEAD/GET for `Last-Modified` header
  - **Comparison:** if external source date ≤ `last_verified` → auto-bump `last_verified` to today (safe — source unchanged); if external > `last_verified` → flag for manual review (source changed; Compass doc may be stale); errors flag without action.
  - Flags `--apply` (mutate files; default is dry-run), `--today YYYY-MM-DD` (deterministic CI), `--out PATH` (write report to file), `--root DIR` (default `compass`).
  - Exit code 0 = all fresh/safely-bumped; exit 1 = flags or errors present (signals CI to open PR/Issue).
- **`.github/workflows/freshness-check.yml`** — runs `check-freshness.py --apply` weekly (Mondays 06:00 UTC) on Compass repo itself. Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch` also supported. On weeks with bumps → opens PR with diff + report. On weeks with flags only (no bumps) → opens Issue with report. On weeks with everything fresh → no action. Report artifact uploaded for 90-day retention regardless.
- **`compass/scripts/README.md` gained `check-freshness.py` section** — usage, exit codes, detection strategies, accuracy honesty (HTTP-level not semantic), automation note (GitHub Actions weekly), when-to-use guidance.

### Changed

- **`compass/framework/canon.md` `[freshness-check]` entry** — pull-bridge round 2 status updated from "deferred" to "shipped v0.3.7"; round 2 mechanism described concretely (script + workflow); round 3 (v0.4+ distribution) still deferred but with strengthened motivation citing multi-consumer reality.
- **`AGENTS.md` Workflow Structure freshness note** — round 2 status updated from "v0.3.5+ deferred" to "shipped v0.3.7"; mechanism described.

### Notes

- **3-slip commitment closed honestly.** v0.3.3 committed round 2 to v0.3.4; slipped to v0.3.5+; slipped to v0.3.6+; v0.3.6 CHANGELOG set a hard line that a 4th slip would trigger re-examination of whether the workflow-side defense from v0.3.3 was still sufficient. v0.3.7 ships before the 4th slip. **The hard line worked** — it created structural pressure that overcame the rationalization-toward-higher-leverage-substantive-releases pattern. Worth noting as a pattern: explicit slip-counters + hard-line declarations are themselves a form of soft-spec-hardening applied to roadmap commitments.
- **First-run validation surfaced real value immediately.** Dry-run on Compass repo (`python compass/scripts/check-freshness.py`) flagged `compass/roles/reviewer.md` because Codex GitHub had a release published 2026-06-01 (same day as ship); `last_verified` was 2026-05-27. This is the precise scenario the v0.3.3 workflow-side defense was designed for — but it would have caught it at next `/build` invocation, not in the framework repo itself. Round 2 catches it at the source. **First detection event in the framework's history; Codex review format may genuinely need re-verification.** Surface this as a Compass-side action item independent of v0.3.7.
- **Honest scope.** Detection is HTTP-level — timestamp comparison, not content semantic analysis. A doc page may change cosmetically without affecting Compass; the script flags it anyway. Auto-bump only happens when external is UNCHANGED (directional bias toward "flag rather than silently mark fresh"). Semantic-level detection (did the Codex CLI surface ACTUALLY change?) requires LLM + structured-output prompting — round 2.5+ territory if false-positive flagging becomes noisy.
- **Multi-consumer reality named.** During v0.3.7 planning, we observed that aura-app (at framework v0.2.x) and crypto-app (at framework v0.3.x active) have no sync mechanism — manual copy at consumer bootstrap, then drift indefinitely. **This is the round-3 distribution problem from v0.3.3's original framing.** Round 2 detects in the framework repo; round 3 propagates to consumers. Still deferred because round 3 requires real distribution infrastructure (auto-PR to consuming repos, version markers in consumer `compass/config.yaml`, sync tooling). v0.4+ candidate.
- **No new Compass-original this release.** v0.3.7 is infrastructure shipping a previously-named pattern's round-2 mechanism, not a new pattern itself. Catalog still spans 5 shapes / 4 enforcement : 4 usability. **First v0.3.x release without a new Compass-original** — the cadence "one Compass-original per session" broke here for legitimate reason (the round-2 commitment was overdue). Worth surfacing in next `/retro` whether infrastructure releases should count toward the cadence or be tracked separately.
- **GitHub Actions setup notes for Compass repo:** the workflow requires `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` + `issues: write` permissions. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided to Actions by default has these by default; no additional secret required. **First time `.github/workflows/` is being used in the Compass framework repo itself** — previously, the framework repo had no CI; this is the first workflow.
- **What the next `/retro` should examine:**
  - Whether 3-slip commitment closure is the framework's first observed instance of "hard-line declarations creating structural pressure that overcomes rationalization"
  - Whether the first-detection-event (Codex GitHub release on ship day) is coincidence or signal about external-tool change velocity
  - Whether infrastructure-only releases (no new Compass-original) should be tracked separately from substance releases in the per-session cadence promise

## [0.3.6] — 2026-06-01

> **`[mechanical-output-verification]` codified as 4th enforcement-class Compass-original + Codex review process gains Step 0 framework-registration check + 3 new named anti-patterns in `compass/roles/reviewer.md`.** Retro #004 (overdue 2 cycles, fired at improvement #22) surfaced the codification as ready — CB-1.4 build-artifact inspection (1st instance, shipped in v0.3.5 same-day extension) + Codex's own retrospective ("Start with framework registration checks before reading functional tests" + "Prefer 'is this actually deployed by the framework?' over 'do the tests pass?'") = 2 instances of the same shape. Catalog now spans 5 shapes; enforcement class gains a 4th member, **resetting balance to 4 enforcement : 4 usability**.

### Added

- **New `[mechanical-output-verification]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. When a workflow requires a build, deploy, or framework-discovery step, the postcondition is inspection of the build OUTPUT or runtime artifact, not just the build PROCESS exit code. Framework anchors: Next.js manifests · Vercel Functions output · Expo prebuild native config · general principle (when runtime config is data-driven, source ≠ runtime). Sharper version of Principle #14 — the soft spec being rationalized is now subtler ("the build succeeded" / "the tests pass" / "the principle is cited").
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` gained Step 0 framework-registration check.** Before functional analysis, Codex verifies build output / runtime artifact for changes touching framework-discovered surfaces (file-based routing, middleware auto-registration, plugin discovery, asset bundling). REQUIRED for routing-layer / discovery-layer changes; OPTIONAL for pure logic changes. Direct extension of Codex's own self-critique from CB-1.4 ("Start with framework registration checks before reading functional tests").
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` gained Step 4 review-time freshness check.** When a story or DRI Decision names a runtime behavior or file convention as load-bearing, Codex re-verifies the claim against current primary docs of the named tool/framework — does not trust story-as-written. This is `[freshness-check]` applied at review time, not just doc-load time. Promoted to BLOCKER status when the claim is wrong regardless of how cleanly the implementation follows the (incorrect) story.
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` gained 4 new named anti-patterns** that Codex actively looks for: `polished-but-broken` (formalized from v0.3.5; tests pass + build green + narrative coherent + behavior wrong), `direct-import-test-suspicious` (framework-discovery-dependent features with direct-import tests bypass the discovery mechanism), story-claim-trust-without-primary-doc-verification (load-bearing story claims must be re-verified), narrow-bug-focus (finding real bugs at functional layer while missing higher-altitude framework-legality issues — Codex's own self-named failure mode from CB-1.4).
- **`compass/workflows/build.md` Phase 2 step 7** gained explicit `[mechanical-output-verification]` citation linking the existing build-artifact inspection sub-bullet (shipped in v0.3.5 same-day extension) to the canon entry. Retrofit of the formal pattern name onto the prior implementation.
- **`AGENTS.md` "Workflow structure" section gained note** about `[mechanical-output-verification]` as 4th enforcement-class Compass-original. Explicit balance framing: 4 enforcement (cite-or-mark-n/a · refuse-escalate · soft-spec-hardening · mechanical-output-verification) : 4 usability (interaction · freshness · observability · handoff).
- **`compass/templates/workflow-template.md` gained inline commentary** about applying `[mechanical-output-verification]` when workflows include build/deploy/framework-discovery steps.
- **`compass/framework/canon.md` `[freshness-check]` entry extended** with review-time application note (the pattern applies to story claims at review time, not just to Compass-doc-load time).

### Changed

- **Roadmap status update (3rd consecutive slip).** Freshness detection (CI on Compass repo watching external tools and auto-bumping `last_verified` markers) was committed to v0.3.4 (slipped to v0.3.5+) (slipped to v0.3.6+) (still not landing in v0.3.6). Codified into canon.md `[freshness-check]` entry as "v0.3.6+" rather than naming a specific next version. **Per Retro #004 drift signal: if it slips a 4th time, the workflow-side date check from v0.3.3 must be re-examined to confirm it's still sufficient.** Hard line.

### Notes

- **Codification rule satisfied — 2 instances.** Per the 2-3-instance rule, `[mechanical-output-verification]` is the first deferred-candidate to graduate to canon entry in the v0.3 cycle. (Prior canon entries either landed with their first instance, like `[elicitation-with-options]` v0.3.2, or like `[freshness-check]` v0.3.3 where the pattern itself was novel enough to ship at 1st instance with the principle named.) v0.3.6 is the first time a *deferred* pattern was codified after accumulating 2 instances in the wild.
- **Retro #004 informed this release directly.** The retro fired at improvement #22 (2 cycles overdue — itself a Principle #14 instance applied to the framework's own cadence). It surfaced `[mechanical-output-verification]` as ready and ranked it as the top v0.3.6 candidate. The retro framing held ("reports — does not prescribe"); v0.3.6 is the *prescriptive response* to the retro's *informational findings*. Direct framework-on-framework working.
- **Codex's own self-critique drove half the changes.** The 5 self-improvement points from CB-1.4 cycle informed: Step 0 framework-registration check (points 1 + 5) · Step 4 review-time freshness (point 3) · `direct-import-test-suspicious` anti-pattern (point 2) · `narrow-bug-focus` anti-pattern (Codex's own self-named failure). Point 4 (AC consistency check earlier) NOT integrated this round — single instance only, defer to a 2nd instance per codification rule. **First time Compass evolution was driven by a reviewer agent's own retrospective**, not user friction or framework-on-framework reflection alone. Worth watching whether this pattern recurs.
- **Other deferred Compass-originals (per Retro #004 codification readiness ranking):**
  - `[implementation-use-verification]` — 2 arguable instances (lesson 3 from v0.3.5 same-day + Codex point #3 partially); codified into reviewer.md Step 4 in this release as a practical application but NOT promoted to standalone canon entry. If/when it becomes structurally distinct from review-time freshness, promote then.
  - `[defense-in-depth-marker]` — still 1 instance (CB-1.4 only). Defer.
  - `[ac-consistency-check]` — still 1 instance (Codex point #4). Defer.
  - Multi-model review as numbered AGENTS.md principle — already hardened structurally in v0.3.5 same-day extension; promotion to numbered principle still premature.
- **5-shape catalog framing held.** v0.3.6 added 1 member to the existing 5 shapes (enforcement class gained `[mechanical-output-verification]`); did not introduce a 6th shape. Worth continuing to validate against the next 2-3 Compass-originals.
- **One Compass-original per session discipline.** 6 sessions running (v0.3.1 → v0.3.6). Cadence holds.
- **Correction (PR #1, 2026-06-02 — consumer-driven, crypto-app):** the Next.js anchors in `[mechanical-output-verification]` (canon.md + reviewer.md Step 0 + build.md Phase 2 step 7 + AGENTS.md) originally cited `.next/server/middleware-manifest.json` as the load-bearing artifact. Correct for Next 13–15; **wrong for Next 16+**. Next 16 relocated middleware/proxy registration to `.next/server/functions-config-manifest.json` (`/_middleware` entry with `runtime: "nodejs"` + matchers); the legacy file still exists but is **empty by design** in 16.x — anchoring on it would create exactly the `polished-but-broken` failure mode the canon entry was designed to close. PR #1 leads with the Next 16 anchor + retains pre-v16 anchor with the "empty by design on 16.x" caveat. **Discovered organically by crypto-app's CB-1.4 cycle on Next 16** — downstream Codex reviewer flagged the institutionalized-wrong-artifact during the v0.3.5 → v0.3.6 sync PR. **Distribution round-3 flowing organically in reverse** — consumer → framework correction, where the v0.3.7 roadmap was thinking framework → consumer propagation. Worth surfacing in next `/retro`: parallel-testbed consumer arrangements (aura-app pre-v16 + crypto-app v16) surface version-sensitivity in framework codifications that single-testbed development can't see. **The codification stands; the citation correction strengthens it** — this is also arguably a 2nd structurally-distinct instance of `[mechanical-output-verification]` (same pattern, different framework version), reinforcing the v0.3.6 codification rather than challenging it.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-06-01

> **`[agent-handoff]` Compass-original pattern + agent-agnostic GitHub Actions reviewer template + `/build` Phase 5 automated path.** User reported the Claude → Codex handoff as the last manual seam in an otherwise automated `/build` loop — terminal switch + manual prompt paste + manual return signal three times per review cycle. Compass ships the pattern (5-piece handoff shape) and a reference GitHub Action that consuming repos drop into `.github/workflows/` to remove the seam. **Agent-agnostic by design** per user direction ("AI → AI where AI can be Claude, Codex, or any other"). **5th Compass-original shape: handoff** (how the workflow PASSES BATON across agents).

### Added

- **New `[agent-handoff]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. Names the 5-piece handoff shape: trigger artifact · trigger event · context window · output medium · loop signal. Agent-agnostic — the pattern abstracts over which AI plays the reviewer role. Compass ships the protocol + a parameterized GitHub Actions template; consumers customize per their reviewer.
- **`compass/scripts/agent-handoff.yml`** — GitHub Actions template. Triggers via `workflow_run` after CI succeeds on a `pull_request` event; resolves PR number; captures diff with `gh pr diff`; invokes the reviewer agent (one of four blocks: **Codex (default-enabled)** · Claude headless · Gemini · generic); posts findings as PR comment via `gh pr comment`. Permissions: `contents: read` + `pull-requests: write`. Falls through cleanly if no open PR found for the branch.
- **`compass/scripts/README.md` gained `agent-handoff.yml` section** with setup steps, handoff-shape table, agent-agnostic blocks summary, accuracy honesty (vendor CLI drift, replay/cost caveats, auth model), and manual-fallback note. Section includes freshness markers (`last_verified: 2026-06-01`, `freshness_window_days: 30`) tracking the Codex / Claude Code / Gemini CLI external sources — per `[freshness-check]`.
- **`/build` Phase 5 step 13 updated** to reference the automated path: "If `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml` is installed (per `compass/scripts/agent-handoff.yml`), the reviewer fires automatically on CI-green; otherwise the reviewer is invoked manually." Both paths terminate at the same place (structured findings as PR comment); automation removes tool-switch + manual prompt paste only. Manual fallback retained — automation is opt-in per consuming repo.
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` gained "How you're invoked" section** documenting both paths (automated via CI / manual fallback). Notes that freshness-check precondition (`/build` Phase 5 step 12a) runs before either path — stale `last_verified` blocks review entirely.
- **`compass/templates/workflow-template.md` gained inline commentary** on the agent-handoff pattern as an optional addition when workflows route work across agents. Notes the manual-fallback-stays-documented convention and that vendor CLI flags drift (sibling README tracks `last_verified`).
- **`AGENTS.md` "Workflow structure" section gained note** about `[agent-handoff]` as 5th Compass-original. Explicitly names the catalog spanning **five shapes**: enforcement · interaction · freshness · observability · handoff.
- **`compass/scripts/` directory framing in AGENTS.md updated** to reflect mixed contents (script + template): "Reference utility scripts AND templates that complement workflows. Each script/template single-file + stdlib-only + operator-friendly. Current entries: `token-usage.py` · `agent-handoff.yml`."

### Changed

- **Roadmap adjustment (2nd consecutive bump).** v0.3.3 committed v0.3.4 to freshness detection; v0.3.4 already bumped that to v0.3.5+; this round bumps it again to **v0.3.6+**. Token tracking (v0.3.4) and handoff automation (v0.3.5) were higher-leverage given user friction. Two consecutive bumps is a yellow flag — worth a `/retro` mention next time. Freshness-check workflow-side defense (v0.3.3) and `agent-handoff.yml` README's own freshness markers (v0.3.5) stand as user-side defense until detection ships.

### Notes

- **Agent-agnostic by user direction.** User said: *"ideally - AI → AI where AI can be Claude, Codex, or any other."* Template ships with four reviewer blocks (Codex default-enabled, Claude headless / Gemini / generic commented). Consumers pick one + set the matching API-key secret. The pattern generalizes; the YAML ships ready-to-customize.
- **Manual fallback always supported.** Pre-v0.3.5 behavior (open terminal, run `codex` against the reviewer prompt) is documented in `compass/roles/reviewer.md` and `/build` Phase 5. Automation is opt-in per repo. The framework does not assume CI infrastructure exists.
- **Vendor CLI drift is real and named.** The `npm install` packages and CLI flags shipped in the template are best-effort references; CLI surfaces drift. `compass/scripts/README.md` carries explicit freshness markers tracking Codex / Claude Code / Gemini CLI external sources. Verify before adoption; bump `last_verified` after confirming.
- **No replay protection in v0.3.5.** Every CI green triggers a reviewer invocation; CI re-runs trigger re-reviews. Acceptable for most projects; high-volume teams should add `concurrency:` groups or label gating. README names this as a future-script candidate.
- **`[agent-handoff]` is 1st instance.** Per codification rule (≥2-3 instances before promoting to AGENTS.md principle), wait for a 2nd workflow adopting it before considering principle #17 status. Likely 2nd instance: a future `/research` or `/triage` workflow needing cross-agent handoff (Researcher → Architect, Triager → Engineer).
- **No regression.** v0.3.4 `[role-boundary]` markers in `/build` still in place; v0.3.3 freshness-check precondition still in place; v0.3.2 elicitation-with-options + foundation-architecture intact; v0.3.1 Access & Data Posture intact.
- **Compass-originals catalog now spans five shapes.** Enforcement (cite-or-mark-n/a · refuse-escalate · soft-spec-hardening — what the workflow REQUIRES); interaction (elicitation-with-options — how the workflow ASKS); freshness (freshness-check — how the workflow STAYS CURRENT); observability (role-boundary — how the workflow EXPOSES STRUCTURE); **handoff (agent-handoff — how the workflow ROUTES across agents)**. The split between "what the framework demands" (enforcement) vs. "how the framework makes itself usable" (interaction · freshness · observability · handoff) is increasingly the load-bearing organization axis.
- **v0.3 cadence held: one Compass-original per session.** v0.3.1 (Access & Data Posture) · v0.3.2 (elicitation-with-options) · v0.3.3 (freshness-check) · v0.3.4 (role-boundary) · v0.3.5 (agent-handoff). Worth a retro after the next release lands (v0.3.6) — that will be improvement #21 cumulatively, near the next `/retro` fire counter.
- **Real-world validation — same day as ship (2026-06-01).** During aura-app CB-1.4's `/build` Phase 2, the Vercel routing-middleware skill (loaded by the Engineer agent independently of Compass freshness markers) surfaced **CVE-2025-29927** and the "middleware/proxy auth as sole protection" anti-pattern. Engineer captured the defense-in-depth design as a DRI Decision + source-code marker at the top of `proxy.ts`; future protected route handlers MUST re-verify session themselves rather than trusting the proxy's injected `x-session-user-id` / `x-session-id` headers as auth claims. **Four patterns fired together:** skill discipline (AGENTS.md) · soft-spec hardening (#14 — middleware-auth-as-sole-protection is exactly the rationalization surface) · DRI logging (#4 — captures *why* not *what*) · role-boundary source-code marker (file-level convention encoding). First observed evidence that framework discipline + skill ecosystem + tool currency compose to catch a CVE-relevant insight at design time, before deploy. Worth citing in next `/retro` as concrete validation of the freshness-check-class + skill-load-class composition. **Codification candidate** (defer per 2-3-instance rule): a `[defense-in-depth-marker]` Compass-original — source-code marker + DRI Decision + future-handler obligation. Would be 4th enforcement-class member if it ships, resetting catalog balance to 4:4 enforcement-vs-usability. Wait for 2nd instance.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-27

> **`[role-boundary]` Compass-original pattern + reference token-usage parser + new `compass/scripts/` framework directory.** User asked for per-role token tracking ("a way to capture the tokens used at every role"). Token tracking is genuinely the AI tool's job, but Compass can help by defining a role-boundary marker protocol and shipping a sample parser that attributes Claude Code session tokens to roles using the markers as anchors. **PM-owned** by convention (matches existing `/status` + `/plan` ownership of "make work visible" jobs).

### Added
- **New `[role-boundary]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. Workflow steps that load or transition roles include HTML-comment markers — `<!-- COMPASS_ROLE_BOUNDARY: <enter|exit> | role=<name> | workflow=<id> | step=<N> -->`. Markers serve two purposes: documentation (translators see explicit role transitions) and parser anchors (the reference script attributes session tokens). Accuracy is rough, not exact — heuristics named explicitly in the parser's Confidence footer.
- **New `compass/scripts/` framework directory.** Reference utility scripts that complement workflows. First convention: single-file, stdlib-only, PM-operable. Justified by token tracking being structurally hard to solve with markdown docs alone. Sibling `README.md` per script for usage docs.
- **`compass/scripts/token-usage.py`** — single-file Python 3 stdlib parser. Reads a Claude Code session log + the workflow's role-boundary markers; produces a markdown report with per-workflow cost / per-role rollup / per-step breakdown. Default pricing $3/M input + $15/M output (Anthropic Sonnet 4.x family, 2026-05); configurable via `--price-in` / `--price-out`. Auto-detects workflow from session's first slash-command; can override via `--workflow`. Writes to stdout or `--out <path>`.
- **`compass/scripts/README.md`** — usage docs. Common Claude Code session-log locations per OS; invocation examples; accuracy honesty (linear-step assumption, multi-message approximation, user-interrupt sensitivity, pricing assumption); how the markers work; PM-ownership convention; candidates for future scripts (freshness detector, multi-session aggregator, marker linter).
- **`/build` workflow gained `[role-boundary]` markers** as the first instance. Engineer enters at Phase 2 step 3; exits at Phase 2 step 7. Reviewer enters at Phase 3 step 8; exits at Phase 3 step 10. Engineer re-enters at Phase 4 step 11; exits at step 12. Reviewer enters at Phase 5 step 12a; exits at step 16. Engineer re-enters at Phase 5 step 17; exits at step 18. Tech Writer enters at Phase 7 step 24; exits at step 28. Six matched enter/exit pairs across the multi-role workflow.
- **`compass/roles/project-manager.md` gained token-usage rollup as a PM responsibility.** New "When you play this role" bullet (manual invocation, no schedule). New "Output artifacts" entry for `docs/usage/<session-id>.md` when PM archives a report. Reference parser noted as adaptable for team-specific reporting needs.
- **`AGENTS.md` "Workflow structure" section gained note** about `[role-boundary]` as the third Compass-original interaction-class pattern (after `[elicitation-with-options]` v0.3.2 and `[freshness-check]` v0.3.3). Also brief mention of `compass/scripts/` as a new framework directory.
- **`compass/templates/workflow-template.md` gained inline commentary** on role-boundary markers as an optional addition when role transitions happen within the workflow.

### Changed
- **Roadmap adjustment:** v0.3.3 release notes committed v0.3.4 to **freshness detection** (CI on Compass repo watching external tools, auto-bumping `last_verified` markers). This round prioritizes token tracking instead. **Freshness detection bumps to v0.3.5+** — noted in canon.md `[freshness-check]` entry and AGENTS.md Workflow Structure note. The freshness-check workflow-side defense from v0.3.3 stands as the user-side defense until detection ships.

### Notes
- **Accuracy honesty.** The parser is a rough estimator. Round 1 = workflow-marker + parser; Round 2+ accuracy lands when richer AI-tool integration matures (Claude Code feature request territory). The Confidence footer in the report names the heuristics used so consumers know the bounds.
- **PM ownership = light touch this round.** PM manually invokes the parser when token-usage visibility is wanted. **No new `/usage` workflow.** Future v0.3.x can promote to a workflow if integration becomes load-bearing.
- **No regression.** v0.3.3 `[freshness-check]` intact (build.md Phase 5 step 12a still present); v0.3.2 `[elicitation-with-options]` intact; v0.3.1 Access & Data Posture intact.
- **`[role-boundary]` is 1st instance.** Per codification rule (≥2-3 instances before promoting to AGENTS.md principle), wait for a 2nd workflow adopting it before considering principle #17 status. Likely 2nd instance: retroactive marker application to `/create-brief` or `/setup-product` (both multi-role).
- **Compass-originals catalog now spans four shapes.** Enforcement (cite-or-mark-n/a · refuse-escalate · soft-spec-hardening — what the workflow REQUIRES); interaction (elicitation-with-options — how the workflow ASKS); freshness (freshness-check — how the workflow STAYS CURRENT); observability (role-boundary — how the workflow EXPOSES STRUCTURE). Worth watching whether a 5th shape surfaces as the framework grows.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-27

> **`[freshness-check]` Compass-original pattern + Codex format as first application (pull-bridge round 1 of 3).** User ran `/build`; Codex review failed because Codex's format had changed and Compass's docs about the format had gone stale. Class problem — same drift surface hits MCP APIs, library versions, vendor conventions, cloud platform docs. Establishes a structural defense.

### Added
- **New `[freshness-check]` Compass-original entry** in `compass/framework/canon.md`. Compass docs that reference external-tool formats / APIs / conventions get frontmatter markers (`last_verified`, `freshness_window_days`, `external_source`); workflows that depend on those docs add a Precondition that refuses if stale. Missing `last_verified` treated as infinitely stale (forces one-time backfill on first use). Closes the soft-spec-rationalization surface where Compass docs silently go stale against evolving external tools.
- **`compass/roles/reviewer.md` gained freshness frontmatter** — `last_verified: 2026-05-27`, `freshness_window_days: 30`, `external_source: https://github.com/openai/codex`. Existing "Review output format" section renamed to **"Expected Codex output shape"** with explicit field-by-field expectations (severity tag brackets, File:line format, three labeled sub-fields per finding, terminal verdict block, top-checklist order). The structured format gives `[freshness-check]` something semantically verifiable in future rounds.
- **`/build` Phase 5 gained step 12a — freshness-check precondition.** Before Codex review begins, reads `reviewer.md` frontmatter; refuses with pointer to external source + file to update if stale or markers missing. Per Principle #16 — refuse + escalate to the doc that owns the external-tool reference.
- **`AGENTS.md` "Workflow structure" section gained note** about `[freshness-check]` as the second Compass-original interaction-class pattern (after `[elicitation-with-options]`).

### Notes
- **Pull-bridge model toward push.** User's framing was *"compass should always check for latest changes and update the user or the doc … it should ideally be a push from compass to the repo owners."* Push is right long-term but requires two pieces of infrastructure that don't exist today: **detection** (something watches external tools) and **distribution** (something delivers updates to consuming repos). v0.3.3 is round 1 — workflow-side check at invocation time. **v0.3.4** will add detection (CI on Compass repo watches Codex / MCP / library / Vercel changelogs; auto-updates Compass docs + bumps `last_verified`). **v0.4+** will add distribution (Compass framework updates auto-propagate as PRs to consuming repos, per user pick *"pushed doc updates"*). Each step delivers value; final state is push.
- **No detection infrastructure this round.** v0.3.3 is mechanical date-based check only. User manually verifies + updates after checking external source. Detection is v0.3.4 territory; bundling now would push back the immediate unblock.
- **No application beyond Codex format.** MCP connector specs, library versions in `/setup-foundation-architecture` elicitation options, Vercel deploy conventions all get freshness markers when each becomes a load-bearing concern in a future session (same one-per-session discipline as workflow hardening).
- **`[freshness-check]` not codified as AGENTS.md cross-cutting principle yet.** Per codification rule — wait for ≥2 applications. This is instance 1; next instance (likely MCP or library) triggers principle #17 status.
- **Trigger:** real Codex format drift broke a `/build` invocation in aura-app. Same dogfood-driven evidence trail as v0.3.0-alpha, v0.3.1, v0.3.2.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-27

> **`/setup-foundation-architecture` hardened to v0.3 template + interactive elicitation pattern introduced.** Second workflow translation in the v0.3 cycle. Bundles three things in one release per user direction: (1) v0.3 hardening (gate/work/postcondition template translation), (2) framework grounding section (per v0.3.0-alpha Part 2 — every v0.3+ workflow has it), (3) **NEW `[elicitation-with-options]` Compass-original pattern** — workflow asks user about each architecture decision, presents 3 widely-used options with "Other (specify)" escape, captures pick + rationale + per-pillar implication.

### Added
- **`compass/framework/canon.md` gained 3 entries:**
  - **New top-level section "Architecture frameworks"** with: `[well-architected]` (AWS Well-Architected Framework — 6 pillars; 2015 + sustainability added 2021) and `[evolutionary-architecture]` (*Building Evolutionary Architectures* — Ford / Parsons / Kua, 2017; fitness functions as continuous architectural tests).
  - **Compass-originals section gained `[elicitation-with-options]`** — interaction pattern for surfacing choices to the user. Static anchor (3 options) + cascading subsequent decisions (3 options biased by prior picks) + "Other (specify)" escape valve. Each pick captured with rationale + per-pillar implication. First applied in `/setup-foundation-architecture`.
- **`/setup-foundation-architecture` translated to v0.3 hardening template** — full gate/work/postcondition structure (16 Phase A steps + 5 Phase B steps); framework grounding section; preserved all v0.1.11 / v0.1.12 / v0.2.4 / v0.2.7 behavior (Phase A/B HITL gate split, foundational data model derived before stack picks, bet-arch deviation gate reference, multi-target canary, ADR / Amendments).
- **NEW interactive elicitation behavior:** anchor decision (primary language + deployment model) + 4 cascading stack-layer elicitations (frontend / backend / data / ops). Each presents 3 widely-used options + Other. Layer cascades bias options by prior picks (e.g., anchor=TS+Vercel → frontend options favor Next.js + Turbopack + Tailwind). Backend elicitation's auth model derives from foundation-product Access & Data Posture (v0.3.1); divergence triggers refuse + escalate (Principle #16). Data stack elicitation cites Foundational Data Model (v0.1.12); DB pick that ignores entity shape fails postcondition. Each pick records per-pillar implication (replaces v0.1.11 separate pillar-scoring step; pillar scoring now baked into each elicitation step's Postcondition).
- **`compass/templates/foundation-architecture.md` gained "Stack picks (elicited)" section** between Foundational Data Model and Stack — captures anchor + 4 layer picks with cited option, cascade rationale, one-line rationale, one-line per-pillar implication per pick.
- **`compass/templates/workflow-template.md` gained inline commentary** on elicitation steps as a valid Steps pattern (when the workflow's job is to capture user choices).
- **`AGENTS.md` "Workflow structure" section gained note** about the elicitation pattern as a named Compass-original; pointer to `canon.md` entry.

### Changed
- **Deliberate violation of v0.3.0-alpha "preserve all existing behavior" hardening rule.** The elicitation pattern is a real behavior change (replaces "draft with smart defaults, ask for approval" with "ask user, present curated options, capture pick"). Per user direction. Documented as precedent break in `compass/workflows/improvements.md` so future translators don't quietly assume the rule still binds.
- **Pillar scoring restructured** — previously a separate concern in the old "Make project-level choices" step (v0.1.11). Now baked into each of the 5 elicitation steps' Postconditions (anchor + 4 layers each capture per-pillar implication). No loss of pillar discipline; restructured for the elicitation flow.
- **Phase A step count: 12 → 16** (added 5 elicitation steps; removed 1 old "Make project-level choices" step). Phase B unchanged (5 steps, renumbered 17-21).

### Notes
- **Scoping discipline preserved.** This is the 2nd workflow translation in v0.3; one workflow per session, deliberate pace. `/create-brief` (every-bet declares Access & Data per v0.3.1 pattern) and `/create-bet-architecture` (deviation gate semantics + bet-level data model) are next candidates — separate sessions.
- **`[elicitation-with-options]` is 1st instance** of a new Compass-original pattern. Per codification rule (≥2-3 instances before promoting to AGENTS.md principle), wait for a 2nd workflow adopting it before considering principle #17 status. Likely 2nd instance: retroactive enhancement of `/setup-product` Access & Data Posture fields (v0.3.1) to use elicitation-with-options for the 3 enums — would land as v0.3.3 or later.
- **Density measure** (v0.3.0-alpha) applied: each elicitation step is load-bearing (captures a decision + rationale + pillar implication). Density check after translation should hold or improve vs original.
- **Trigger:** user picked `/setup-foundation-architecture` as the next workflow to harden per v0.3 cadence + requested the elicitation pattern as new behavior. Same dogfood-driven evidence trail as v0.3.0-alpha and v0.3.1.

> **Foundational issue named: every product bet declares Access & Data Posture.** First time auth/identity gets named at the framework level. Aura-app dogfooding revealed `/setup-foundation-architecture` skipped auth entirely; Explore-agent triage confirmed the gap is upstream at the foundation-product layer (template has no auth/access section; Verification has zero auth gates; 16 AGENTS.md principles, none names this).

### Added
- **New "Access & Data Posture" section in `compass/templates/foundation-product.md`**, placed after Personas. Three foundational fields: auth posture (anonymous · registered · authenticated · MFA-required · regulated-identity) · data sensitivity (none · public · PII · sensitive · regulated) · regulatory regime (none · GDPR · HIPAA · SOC 2 · PCI DSS · sector-specific · combination). Closed enums; mandatory; `n/a — <reason>` allowed for genuinely non-applicable cases (e.g., internal build tooling); per Principle #15 — empty / unjustified-n/a fails.
- **`/setup-product` Step 5 gained explicit elicitation sub-bullet.** Workflow now **asks the user the 3 questions conversationally** rather than trusting the agent to populate the section silently. Per Principle #14 — silent skipping is the failure mode; explicit elicitation closes the rationalization surface.
- **Verification gate item** added to `/setup-product`: section populated, all 3 fields with value or `n/a — <reason>`; HITL gate cannot pass otherwise.

### Notes
- **Scoped tight on purpose.** `/setup-product` only this round. `/create-brief` (every-bet declares Access & Data) and `/setup-foundation-architecture` (auth model derived from product posture) deferred to v0.3.2+. Decide-before-derive: product sets posture; downstream derives.
- **No new AGENTS.md principle yet.** The "every bet declares access & data" pattern would be principle #17, but only one instance exists (foundational product). Per the codification rule (≥3-5 instances before promoting), wait for `/create-brief` treatment in v0.3.2 to land a 2nd instance, then codify.
- **Pattern reuse:** closed enums + n/a-with-reason mirrors Story Standard Experience checklist (v0.2.6). Cite-or-mark-n/a per Principle #15. Conversational elicitation step mirrors how Researcher's 6-category framework (v0.1.8) catches the soft-spec-rationalization failure mode.
- **Aura-app trigger:** user ran `/setup-foundation-architecture` on a project, observed it neither asked about authentication nor scaffolded any auth-related boundary. Explore-agent triage confirmed: template silent, workflow silent, no prior improvements entry, no principle naming it. First-time-named at framework level.
