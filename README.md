# Compass

> Product development with direction.

A vendor-neutral product development framework. Compass holds the shape of work from problem → ship → measure → learn, with AI tools playing roles across the lifecycle.

## What Compass is

A markdown-based framework that any AI tool can read. The framework lives in `compass/`. **Agents are self-sufficient, surface-independent units** (`compass/agents/<agent>.md`) — the same agent file runs on ChatGPT Custom GPT Instructions, Claude Code session, Codex prompt, Gemini system message, or as a CrewAI / LangGraph agent definition. **Host wrappers** (`CLAUDE.md`, future host analogs) are thin runtime-notes, not role authorities. Per `[agent-as-surface-independent-unit]` (canon v0.3.14).

## Core ideas

- **Every initiative is a bet.** Foundation product, OKRs, features, architectural initiatives — all measurable bets with a hypothesis, key metric, and an outcome: **won / learning / inconclusive**.
- **Bets contain stories.** Stories contain implementation, tests, fixes, ops.
- **Agents own tasks; workflows sequence agents.** 13 agent files in `compass/agents/` (migrating from `compass/roles/`; v0.3.14 ships pm + researcher + engineer, rest follow incrementally). Each agent file is self-sufficient: identity + inlined principles + tools required + task definitions (gate/work/postcondition) + refusal rules + handoffs. Workflow files in `compass/workflows/` are **thin dispatch graphs** that sequence `<agent>.<task>` references — they don't embed methodology; the methodology lives in the agent task definitions where it belongs.
- **Surface-independent by design.** Each agent declares `preferred_hosts: [...]` in its own frontmatter (e.g., `pm.md` runs on ChatGPT or Claude; `engineer.md` prefers CLI hosts with filesystem access). Paste any agent file into the host's system-prompt slot → it works. **Cross-host orchestration today is human-dispatched** (open the right host for the active step); **v0.4 ships the orchestrator** that walks dispatch graphs and dispatches agents per step automatically. **Default Reviewer ≠ Implementer** for review independence — Compass empirically validates Claude implements, Codex reviews; the cross-model split is preserved structurally via agent `preferred_hosts:`. Per `[agent-as-surface-independent-unit]` (canon v0.3.14). *Legacy:* `compass/config.yaml.tool_assignments:` deprecated in v0.3.14; removed in v0.4.
- **Discipline holds always.** Full review on every PR, no shortcuts under pressure.
- **Decisions, Risks, Issues** logged at every stage (DRI logs).
- **Compass scans your product like Snyk scans your code.** A continuous quality scanner runs across six SDLC phases — Product, Architecture, Build, Production Ready, GTM, Operate — and produces *findings, not failures*. Each finding has severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low) + confidence + location + reason + fix. Measurement is automatic (no manual self-assessment). Suppressions are explicit, justified, logged in DRI. Owners decide; the scanner informs.

## The flow

17 workflows, grouped by **when you reach for them**. Several Observe workflows are auto-invoked by others — marked `[auto]` and rarely called by hand.

### 1. Bootstrap — once per project

Sequenced. Run in order on a new repo.

```
/setup-product                  → Foundation product bet (PM + Researcher)
/setup-foundation-architecture  → Foundation architecture bet + data model (Enterprise Architect)
/create-bet-portfolio           → MVP wedge: 3-6 stub briefs + dependency graph (PM + Researcher)
```

### 2. Plan — per bet

Define what a bet is, design it, decompose into shippable slices.

```
/create-brief                   → New bet — fresh OR promote portfolio stub (PM + Researcher)
/create-bet-architecture        → Bet-level technical strategy (Architect + Enterprise Arch)
/create-story                   → One shippable slice under the bet (PM, +Designer/UX Writer if UI)
```

### 3. Execute — per story / event

Do the work. Build for stories; the others for the reactive cases.

```
/build <story>                  → Engineer implements + Codex reviews + Architect compliance
/fix <ticket>                   → Bug flow (Support → Engineer → Codex)
/triage <alert>                 → Incident response (Engineer + Support + PO awareness)
/ops <change>                   → Infra / config / non-code changes (Enterprise Arch + Codex)
```

### 4. Observe — rolling visibility

You invoke `/status`, `/scan`, `/metrics` on demand. `/plan`, `/dashboard`, `/measure` typically run themselves.

```
/status                         → Project Manager's rolling status
/scan <bet>                     → Snyk-style continuous quality scanner — 6 SDLC phases
/metrics                        → Outcomes (won/learning/inconclusive) + open-findings posture
/plan                           → Living time-bound schedule (run manually or via cron)
/dashboard             [auto]   → Single-file HTML view of all living artifacts
                                  (refreshed by /scan, /metrics, /plan, /status)
/measure <bet>         [cron]   → Cron-driven bet outcome resolution
```

> **Phase transitions:** flip the artifact's `status:` field directly (`proposed` → `approved` → `in-build` → `shipped` → etc.). No canonical "advance" command — that's what status fields are for.

## Get started

## Heads-up: AI tool memory persists across folder deletion

If you reuse a folder path for a new Compass project (delete + recreate at the same path), AI tools may carry stale context from the prior project. See `SETUP.md` → "Starting fresh at the same folder path" for the cleanup steps.

Read `SETUP.md`.
